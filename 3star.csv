"November 30, 2018","Jared V","-","yes","Way too big","I got CAH and the three color box expansions (red, blue, and green). The only large expansion I don't have is the Absurd pack (I don't have any of the little 20/30 card packs). That being said, the base game plus all official big packs but one barely fill up 2/5ths of this box. I have no idea why it is so damn big. You'll have to get lots of unofficial knock-off expansions if you intend on filling this box up. If I had every single official Cards Against Humanity card, I'd still have this thing half empty. If you have lots of extra card games to put in, that might make this box more sensible, but again- be prepared to not have a full box if you stick to the official cards.","3","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25UUMU1Q604VI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"June 27, 2014","Shawn Davis","-","yes","A fun game, but you can't play it often","If you are a fan of 'social' games where the larger goal is conversation rather than competition this can be a really fun game to play with friends.  Its very similar to 'Apples to Apples' so if you are a fan of that game then this would also be a good pick.My biggest complaint is that the number of cards is small, so after playing a few rounds with a large group, you have gone through the whole deck and its much harder to have a good time after having seen them all.  After this, you basically need to wait a while to play again in order to be forget enough of the cards for it to be fresh again.Obviously not a game to consider playing with kids.","3","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39N63Y888XQAU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

If the people you are playing with having never expressed an interest in funny written material (Seriously, like they aren't big readers) I would pass on this game and get something more interactive.That said, I was the ideal candidate in the group for this game and while I found it cute, I did not find it super-LOL-vulgar (which is what I was hoping for).You've probably seen the pics on line of people playing and getting some REALLY horrible/crass/hilarious combinations - those are not that common from what we saw in 20 mins... you would get stuff like 'I like to [mow the lawn] with [ham sandwiches]' -- ok, if I'm tired and a little tipsy that might be funny, but it's not X-rated humor.So just keep that in mind; maybe I was expecting the wrong thing (little more R-rated content and universal hilarity), but that was my experience anyway.","3","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YY3M9UI2N6QB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

I imagine you can buy the expansions to keep it entertaining but after you've gone through all of those cards once the game can get old quickly. $100+ later you have another boring game to donate or resell....

"September 3, 2014","Joe","-","-","Completely Disappointed in the Quality, but still a Great Game","This is the second time I have purchased a set of these cards, so I know what I'm talking about when I say the quality of the card stock and the printing has slipped significantly in the past year or so.  My original set, purchased in March of 2013, had a full set of flawless cards that held up against even the sloppiest of uses (spilled beer, salsa, etc.) without needing more than a quick wipe down to return to perfect condition.  The set of cards I received recently (my previous set was stolen; shocking I know) are nothing like the last set I had.  They're made from noticeably cheaper cardstock, I'm less than confident in their water resistance, they're ALL bowed as if they have been exposed to moisture already (even though the first set probably wouldn't have bowed if they were left in a pool of water), some of the printing on some of the cards is already smudging (rubbing with one's clean finger can produce a smudge, never mind a greasy or salsa covered finger), and one card has a distinct marr on the edge of it making it easy to pick out in someone's hand, or draw pile.  I am thoroughly disappointed in this latest set of cards form CAH and suggest you hold off to buy a set until reports of their card quality either return to excellent, or the price halves (these are not worth the $25 asking price in my opinion).","3","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM4RIQBXFUGWJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
