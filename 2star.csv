"December 26, 2017","diana waggoner","-","-","Sexual content in game","The package arrived timely. However  this card game was more inappropriate than I expected. I was expecting it to be somewhat inappropriate from the reviews I read but it contained much more sexual questions and content that I expected.  I thought I researched enough but it was partly  my fault for not reviewing more information. In the proper setting and group these questions may be funny but not for a family.  I would not let my 17 yr old son play this game and did not want to play with my inlaws or mother!  My 23 yr old son may find it funny with his group of friends.  Just beware it includes alot of sexual content before your purchase.","2","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T5NQOSMPOKN2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"January 2, 2017","Dan High","-","yes","Pass","Played this game for the first time on New Year's.  Some of the cards are extremely inappropriate, I expected that and generally those are the most humorous. We played with 4 people, there seemed to be a lot of dead time. At several points we decided to ditch an agreed amount of cards for fresh ones because they sucked so bad. Also at several points we decided to scrap the round because none of the cards were funny.  Game should come with some blank cards allowing players to create some of their own. 25$ is highway robbery for this glorified set of cards, and honestly I will probably never play again.","2","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10YXSRJW2T9EE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"December 5, 2016","Eddie Stardust","-","yes","Taking no real risks, the game plays itself.","I anticipated irreverence and tastelessness, but I thought the game would allow for much more creativity. Instead, it opens up the opportunity to express dark, but rarely funny responses; hatefully good fun? The problem is that the game doesn't leave any room for a deeper engagement, nor does it allow players to inject their own humor. The mechanism disallows players to be accountable for espousing potentially horrid personal views, as they are prefabricated.By design, 'Cards Against Humanity' can't be funny, anymore so than can any  humor algorithm; it's just  too arbitrary. Playing is like being forced to watch poorly scripted television comedy of the 80's; the game plays itself.It's a dreary spectacle.","2","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQSWMQ6I9E5IO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

We are big fans of the Apples to Apples card game, which works the same way but is not targeted to adult audiences. I was excited to try this card game since it allows for more salty content and unpolitically correct hands. However, after opening the card deck and reading the phrases, I was very disappointed at how blatantly vulgar and sexual most of the cards are. It seems far to forced and doesn't allow for the fun and nuance of making your own jokes by the choice of card play. As a result, I've had it for over 2 years now and it has never been selected as the game to play. I'm almost a little embarrassed I own it.The construction quality of the card box and the card lamination is excellent, so really the bad review is about the quality of the content, not the quality of the construction of the game.","2","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RPWFWIAOUH3I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

This game is hilarious - a total hoot to play, but the raunchy content ruins it. This would be a great game if the designers would clean it up a bit. As it is, I wouldn't even play it with my teens. Adults only.","2","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GKZGKVUI4LB0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"August 31, 2015","Steven Newman","-","-","Ridiculously crude, and fun for a while.","It's really easy to play, and can be incredibly hilarious. Best played while under the influence of alcohol, in a large group of uncouth rogues.EDIT:I'm changing my review from 4 stars, to 2. I had a lot of fun with this at first, but it lost it's luster for me very quickly.This game is hilarious the first few times you play it, but got old for me real fast. It essentially boils down to whoever gets the nastiest card wins the round, regardless of context.It will always be fun to watch people reading cards for the first time, but I don't think I'll ever voluntarily play this game again.","2","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15CHVGGSXDDEY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

LOL","Let me say there is nothing whatsoever wrong with this card game -- it's just that I didn't look carefully and purchased it for family get-togethers.  My young-adult kids were hysterical with laughter when they saw it.  It's absolutely filthy dirty stuff -- not family fare.  Great for young adults.  People over 50 looking for fun group games just pass on this one.","2","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROJ6DL9WOOAH9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"April 4, 2016","BN Normal","-","yes","Many Better Options","I'd liken this game to a teenager learning to drive a car.  Fun for them at first but gets old quickly.  I enjoyed my first time playing Cards Against Humanity but it got old quickly.  The problem with this game is that the dirtiest played card always seems to win no matter what the topic is so the people I've played with ALWAYS play their dirtiest card.  In addition, the game lacks replayability within the same group because their is a limit to the number of cards and topics.  Combine these two elements and you have a board game you can only play a couple of times with any sort of enthusiasm.  If you have the same circle of friends and are looking for a party game, I'd suggest looking at something else.","2","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D5PY29Y15NOZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

I’ve played Cards Against Humanity with friends and I always wanted to own my own for when I am the host in my own home. The package was delivered in a timely manner. However, some of the cards were damaged within the box and torn on the corners. It was not damaged in shipping as the outside of the box was pristine.

"March 6, 2017","Amazon addict","-","-","If you like shocking and inappropriate games, you might like this.  I'm not a fan.","The quality of the cards is very good.  Box is sturdy.  The idea for the game is interesting.  I'm just not a fan of the game.  It's definitely a game for teens and/or 20 something age range.  Although beware, many of the cards have very adult material.  It can be a little shocking and sick.  I think the developers intended that.  Once you get past that, there is really not much substance to the game and it becomes quite boring.  I don't think the add on's are worth the extra money you spend.  The main game isn't worth the money either.  The game is very subjective as the person judging is doing so in a completely subjective fashion, usually simply based on their own personal perspectives.  I think it is a fad.  Keep in mind, the seller is good and the product quality is fine.  It's the game itself that my review is based on.","2","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XLFMOJT6MECJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Personally, I feel a bit cheated, but I suppose there's nothing to do but take it as it is.I had a chance to play with my brother and I think the game itself is quite fun, addictive, and plain hilarious.
