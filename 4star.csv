Fun game though!!","I was not 100% sure I wanted to get this for my 16 year old daughter to have to play with her teenage friends at her birthday. I did get it and I hung around while they were playing the game,girls and guys all about 16 yrs.old, very interesting,very mature conversations came from some of the cards.My husband and I  actually have fun playing this game with my 2 teenage daughters. You may surprised to learn a few things that your kids know,that you did not realize..you can have fun and learn a few things about your kids,actually leaves a lot of room for discussions with your kids.Some of the cards are rather disgusting,so you may want to take those out of the set.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1D668OESCHZTM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"August 13, 2018","RaubeWanKenobi","-","yes","Great game -- for a handful of game nights","'Cards Against Humanity' is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever had the pleasure of playing in my adult years. Being 24, this is a college party MUST. I also acquired the 1st expansion pack to go along with the game and added my own variations of questions and answers. One of the few downsides to this game is after a few run-throughs and game nights, the cards get repetitive and you can only shuffle the deck so well. On my part, I could continue to buy the expansions to help keep the game interesting for future game nights. A small suggestion would be to come out with an entire blank expansion pack to allow CAH's players to keep the game rolling with new and original content. Other than that, this game is always a win and you'll almost always find someone who hasn't played yet.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSY3Y9M6W9NZJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"November 2, 2015","David H","-","yes","Not for the "PC".","Was introduced to this game by a group of friends while we camped out in front of a theater waiting for the opening showing. It doesn't take long too get the hang of it, and you are really only limited by your own personal 'whimsy'...or some might say 'sick sense of humor'.  It's a funny, often raunchy, easily surreal game that pushes the boundaries (okay, it breaks them) of 'good taste'.If you haven't played, and you have any 'wicked' in your sense of humor, I'd suggest taking a look at this. If you are 'PC', easily offended, way down at the end of the far right or left of any scale, well, then I'd suggest you curl up with a good (?) reality TV show or your favorite 'agrees with you 100%' news broadcaster and leave this 'offensive' game to those of us who can laugh at the adult version of MadLibs.I liked the game so much, I had to come here to buy it. That's my recommendation ;)","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZS3JS1XIYYQL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"December 18, 2016","Bluediamondxoxo","-","yes","Definitely not for serious or easily offended people","This game is hilarious.  I first played it at a bachelorette party.  Although this game greatly offended some people and made them very upset, it brought many, many drunken laughs from the rest of us.  I have since played it sober with my family! Definitely not for serious or easily offended people.  If you worry about being polite, politically correct, or appropriate, do not buy this game!  However, It is definitely fun when you are looking for something stupid and raunchy.  I just bought this game for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift.  I know he will love it!","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYQ4C2DD3AJBC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"October 31, 2017","Son Of The Sea","-","yes","A Fun, Goofy Game for Those With a Sense of Humor","This is a fun, goofy game to bring out if your friends aren't the type to take offense and are maybe a little hesitant about other games. Easy to understand rules and everyone I have played it with had a great time laughing at how ridiculous some of the cards are. After you've seen all of the cards once or twice and it can lose the 'can you believe this card' shine, but it's always fun to bring out to the unexposed.If you're looking for other easy, fun games for parties, Codenames and The Resistance are great once Cards Against Humanity has grown old. You can also keep it fresh with a ton of expansions if you're looking to relive the feeling of being shocked that they put that card in the game.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GKGUNQ9I8KIV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"April 7, 2015","leiacooks","-","yes","simple and very fun","Lost one star because cards were bent but otherwise in good condition.Fun game, even better with larger groups. I absolutely recommend getting the expansion packs if you find yourself playing this a lot, as it will get repetitive.If you do find yourself wanting to play this game with only one other person with you, my boyfriend and I found this to be pretty fun:1) both players get 8 cards2) the person who is not judging cards picks 4 cards they think are the best in response to the black card being played3) they then rate each of the 4 cards. RATING: 7, being the most likely option the person judging will choose, 4, 2, and 1 being the least likely4) the person judging picks the best and whatever point was assigned to that card is the number of points you get. (Keep a white board or paper to keep track)You can mix it up as a drinking game as well, if the card that has only one point gets chosen drink.It's really a simple game and you can have fun mixing up the rules and being creative.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZLYFEXMD0P6W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"January 23, 2018","Chris Larry","-","yes","great for non hobby board gamers who want to play board games/card games.","i personally like the game only because my family members love it. i would prefer to play more competitive games. I rate it 4 because sometimes this is the only way to get the family together at the table for a game night. this is the 2.0 which we had the 1.4 and just went through all the cards that were not in the 2.0 and took them out and gifted the 1.4 to a family member. there is a excel spreadsheet online that tells you all the cards in every expansion and re release which we used to do this process and it only took an hour to find the 100+ cards that were replaced.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q45SHPW2XZVS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"December 20, 2015","Donna","-","yes","Fun game but too many words to look up","This game was all the buzz and I have played it a couple times at parties and I finally decided to buy my very own box of Cards Against Humanity. The game is messed up but it is absolutely hilarious. Although I think the game is kind of hit and miss because not everyone really gets into it and not because its inappropriate or anything but sometimes it kind of gets boring surprisingly enough but mostly because there are a lot of words that are not in people's regular vocabulary so when someone plays a card that know one knows a words definition, it kind of puts a damper on things...Overall I do like the game but you've got to get right crowd of people to play to make it fun and interesting. I have played it with people where would just laugh the whole time and played it with people where it was just a couple laughs here and there. I like the game but I don't like how I have to pull out my dictionary app to try and understand the cards I have and if it is a funny card, it doesn't get chosen because people don't immediately know what the word means but I usually have people switch out cards if they come across something they don't know the definition of.Guess I should extend my vocabulary or something.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T5APUPZL9GX5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"March 23, 2015","Table Top Games Dad","-","yes","Classic game but gets old after about 20 plays","This game is a lot of fun with a large group of close friends. It is also fun in a group with not-so-close friends as you can easily determine if they are horrible people too. There are many house rules associated with this game; mine is that you have to Google image a card you don't know. Get the expansions and play with your friends and you will have a great time. I usually play on Saturday nights so I can cleanse my soul at church the next morning. After playing for the last couple of years the game has lost some of its' fun as the same cards continue to cycle through. I mainly play it now to introduce it to new players who have a great time. Once you play it about 20 times, it begins to get old but is still a classic game for adults only.P.S. Don't play with your parents unless you have copious amounts of alcohol on board.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19B1XTPQJD4P5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"January 27, 2013","blep","-","-","Really fun for a bit but lots of "dud" cards","This game is absolutely hilarious don't get me wrong. The replay value isn't has high as apples to apples though I think. There are some cards that are automatic wins just about every time they are played and there are others that are total duds and get stuck in your hand all game or you waste a turn by playing them and they never, ever win. I've played this game with several different groups of people and the winners and losers are nearly always the same so the game gets a bit predictable. I do recommend this as a must buy though for your next game night, but I can't quite rate it as 5 stars.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7C4DPWEKDZXP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Who can come up with the most assanine response to the cards? I'm glad they have expansion packs though because we played through all the black cards with 4 people in about 2 hours. Still had a lot of white cards left but it's nice to be able to add more to the game in the future. This game is great for people who like to laugh at crude jokes and have a sense of humor.

While things can and  do get inappropriate, gross, and raunchy, that's something to be expected from this game, and occurs in an entertaining manner.The only nitpick is that this game would be better if it included as many cards as Apples to Apples does in its original box instead of forcing you to by expansion packs. When you have 6-8 people, this game, with just the original package, can be over very quickly.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14T95SVC4RABI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Games tend to be short, the call to play a different games comes after a couple of rounds because people are uncomfortable with the questions & answers.I should have edited this review much earlier. Initially I played with a small group of 5. Next I played with a group of 15 to 20. IT WAS FUN!  The card czar was well versed in the rules. There were several first time players. Sometimes we threw all of our cards in because someone had an answer so awesome the table couldn't stop laughing or beat the answer. One first time player laughed and blushed so hard I thought she'd pass out. I don't play often but I have an AWESOME group of 'terrible'  people to play with now!","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HBHJULA2JA1A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"May 31, 2013","J.L.","-","-","Great game when on the road, large groups, parties!","Cards against humanity like what overs have mentioned is like Apples-to-apples. If you haven't played apples before, no worries the game is not difficult to learn and can quickly be taught to large groups of people. This is not a challenging game! You need at least 3 people to play, but what I enjoy about this game the most is that you can have as much people as you want to participate. The cards do not feel cheaply mad, they are like casino playing card quality. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easy fun game that is sure to bring about lots of laughable moments.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A77RGI5G1BWT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"September 24, 2015","Keith","-","-","Pretty Ok","This game is a lot of fun the first handful of times you break it out. After that however the cards begin to lose their 'funny' as they have lost their shock value. Definitely for more mature audiences that are not completely out of touch with pop culture. Trying to explain what the cards means to people makes it less enjoyable, so please leave your grandma out of this one, she will not understand many of the cards meanings and that's just awkward.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R321OBVU5HG9ZE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"December 9, 2013","Nicole Machi","-","yes","funny but short-lived","This game is super funny with the right crown, but it definitely tries too hard. Many of the cards are ridiculous on their own- I prefer more unexpected humor. The best comparison I have is Apples to Apples- they only have a noun and adjective so you have to combine things and make them funny all while keeping the card chooser in mind. This game does that, but also gives a bunch of ridiculous cards that seem meant to 'guarantee' a funny answer, but it takes the creativity of the game away.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N28M8ON9H0T9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

The game is fun but... once you play it once or twice with the same people theres no real need to play it again because you already know all of the cards; they do make expansion packs, but the game is already about $25 and for just some cards printed on paper seems rather pricey.  You can also print them out yourself for free on their website!

"February 18, 2015","Asche Adair","-","yes","It's About Who You Play With","I imagine most people who purchase, or are considering purchasing, Cards Against Humanity already know what the game is all about.In some ways, Cards Against Humanty is an explicit version of Apples to Apples. However, rather than make comparisons, you either fill in the blank or answer a direct question with the cards available in your hand.The makers of this game have done a great job of creating a nice gameplay balance. And, even though the company offers a number of expansion packs, the base game is complete experience.While a certain amount of negativity and bigotry can come out during the gameplay, it's largely dependent on the players. The goal of the game seems more about poking fun at sterotypes, rather than perpetuating them. In fact, the makers of the game have been known to publicly apologize and remove certain cards from future versions for perpetuating negativity and hostlity toward specific groups.How you play and who you play with will really define your experience with this game.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QPKR88WK2MHU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"February 28, 2015","Montgomery Hill","-","-","Worth the Money","Cards Against Humanity was expensive, but for good reason: it's funny and could potentially ruin all the friends you've made because it is what it says on the box. Even I was insulted a couple of times with a few Asian references and was looked down when upon I pulled out one of the race cards. If you and your friends are the type that doesn't get insulted easily and won't make a big deal out of a degrading joke, this is essentially the PERFECT ice breaker for any event. Although, if you play with more than five people, all the cards will have been played within an hour, just trust me. I'm even purchasing getting one of the expansion packs. Keep in mind, however, that this game can be VERY inappropriate at times.

"January 10, 2015","William J Hayes III","-","yes","Cards Against Humanity ALMOST Perfect","Basic premise of game, you draw 10 white cards and then someone reads a black card. There is one or more blanks on black card. Everyone besides the person playing the black card put a white card which is already filled out with a word or sentence and gives it face down to the person reading the black card. The person shuffles cards and then reads each one. The one they like the best wins and that person gets the black card. At the end of the game whoever has the most black cards wins.The only reason this game does not get 5 stars is due to the fact that some cards always win due to the shock factor. Some cards are so shocking they make the person pick them always. Some cards are throw away cards so lame that after a while you give out to people who never pick your card anyways. This game was actually recommended to me by Brian Schulmeister from the 'Grumpy Old Geeks' Podcast. He was discussing playing it so I had a basic concept of what to expect. If you are not expecting to be VERY shocked do NOT buy this game. If you find funny word pairings humorous this game is for you.Pay attention to the Over 17!!!! This is for real! Much cursing and vulgarity. It is my new favorite drinking game though, I cannot wait to get the expansions.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R225DIDSSM67S6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"April 4, 2015","Oxocopper","-","-","Definitely fun, OK replay value if you're creative about it","Love this game- the replay value is not the BEST of the games I own, but decent. I find myself becoming weirdly de-sensitized by the really 'kraaaazy' cards. At this point I prefer when people use the less intense cards creatively, as opposed to being lazy and solely relying on a crazy card (which can also be amazing in the right context of course). With the whole replaying concept - this all happens when you play a lot. It is definitely more fun with a large group of people (this is especially true if you have played a few times), and is really fun as an ice-breaker for people you don't know very well (and an easy way to weed out boring or annoyingly sensitive people). I'll continue to buy expansion packs :)","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U3XFFYHQ903E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"October 10, 2013","D. Patton","-","-","Laugh til you cry","This game is as raunchy as advertised! If you can find humor in stealing cookies from an AIDS bake sale (one of the cards), then you will enjoy this game. If you find that highly offensive (and lots of people understandably will) then stick with apples to apples. It is definitely for a certain audience, and choose your company carefully! Once that is out of the way, get ready to laugh, and laugh and laugh and then cry. We have played this with many different groups, and it is outstanding fun.Repeats are rare as the combos are almost endless. We also got the first expansion, which is great and even raunchier! The randomness and variety is the best part, to see what your friends come up with Example: Q: what was Michael Jackson's dying thoughts? A: switching to Geico.  Unfortunately some of the answers only fit with a handful of cards, and I find the expansion helps with this.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18KF5Z59PK4HD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"October 18, 2014","BeeDee","-","-","This game really is for horrible people. It is similar to Apples to Apples","This game really is for horrible people. It is similar to Apples to Apples, only twisted and terrible. It is a blast when played with a group of open-minded (possibly slightly tipsy) group of friends or family. However, this is not really a game you play with acquaintances or people who don't curse or tell inappropriate jokes. Being extremely liberal minded and not afraid of any topic, word, etc. even I was shocked at a couple of these cards.For the reviews complaining about this not being a kid-friendly game... Shame on you! If there is ever any doubt, be the parent and check things out before playing with your children. The box literally warns that this game is for horrible adults. That isn't a reason to down vote the game.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BKB9Z0BEHC68/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

I leave it four stars only because it is maybe a little too vague in its packaging to warn off the faint of heart. I did my research ahead of time and was still a bit shocked (pleasantly) by some of the naughtier phrases. I was playing with my husband, dad, sister and brother, oh yeah and my MOM! and once or twice avoided using certain cards in my hand because I just didn't want to be that gross. However, it was for the most part hilarious playing this game for the first time with a bunch of other first timers.

The cards are easy to wipe off if you happen to spill something on them (or laugh so hard [or gasp and choke at the horrible wrongness] that you explode on them).The downside for me is that the cards are all so unique that after a few times playing you start getting that deja vu feeling... which is why they have so many expansion packs.

I am so glad I never gave it to her. This game it's straight up raunchy and awful. That being said I found it hilarious and an absolute hysterical time. My siblings and I played until the wee hours of the morning -that's saying a lot considering we both have young kids. Speaking of kids I would not play this around any kids because it's littered with swear words and racial/gender/ politically incorrect jokes.

"September 26, 2015","Tristan","-","-","Great party game, but requires expansions","I find this to be a very fun party game, BUT as most low rating reviews say 'it can get stale', which is true since I played it for the first time with four other people, got through all the cards, and hurt my sides laughing too much. The next day I tried playing again with the same people and it just was not as funny. I tried again with different people months later and got to the point of pain in my stomach again from how funny it is.My recommendation is to get the core set with as many expansions as you can get since the main set has repeated cards and not enough content. Also, play with many other people and space out the time in between for when you play the game so old jokes can become funny again and you forget all the responses to certain black cards.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10D5HYKVPLFUO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Some cards were flimsy and thin, you could see the card stock the print is on. It was kind of annoying. I was expecting a good quality set of cards. It's easy to tell when you hold them side by side which ones are good quality cards. The thin cards obviously show the card stock they are on its not as bright white and sturdy.I'm not too sure if the expansion packs were the same, because we mixed them with the rest, but the main set definitely was a mix of good and thing cards.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MNK84FQKL9FD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"August 25, 2015","Dad's Gaming Addiction","-","yes","Cards Against Humanity Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction","Cards Against Humanity: 4+ Players, Ages 17+, Average Play Time = 30-90 MinutesThere isn’t much to say about the card art…the game comes packaged in a black box with white text.  The cards are similarly designed in that they are either white text on black or black text on white…nothing all that fancy.  The manual is very easy to understand, to the point where you can set up and play within seconds of opening the box.  Even if you’ve never played “Apples to Apples” or similar games before, it will take you perhaps minutes to learn.  The quality of the cards are fair…roughly the same quality as a regular deck of a playing cards in that it’s possible to bend them if you’re not careful.Of course, people who have heard about “Cards Against Humanity” don’t buy it for the card art…rather, they buy it for the content on said cards.  In a word, this content is inappropriate.  This is one game that you should definitely not introduce to your kids, unless they happen to be over seventeen years of age.  The vocabulary by itself is questionable, but some of the combinations that form between the black and white cards can really be…well, let’s just say you wouldn’t (or shouldn’t) repeat them in public.  With only 550 cards, the content does tend to repeat after multiple playthrus.  Luckily, the game variants listed in the manual serve to mix things up a bit.  One variant, for example, eliminates the role of the Card Czar while another introduces an imaginary player named Rando Cardissian (Billy Dee Williams impersonations are optional).As fun as the game is, I’m a bit put off by the price tag.  “Cards Against Humanity” is currently retailing for $25.00, all of which grants you a total of 550 cards.  When you compare that to “Apples to Apples Jr” (576 cards for $10.00) or “Apples to Apples Party Box” (1,000+ cards for $25.00), it’s hard not to be a bit concerned.  The four expansions themselves contain 100 cards each and retail for $10.00 each.  If you add all of that up, you’d come to $65.00 for 950 cards…ouch.  Suddenly the “Apples to Apples Party Box” is looking much more affordable and appealing.  If the card art were superb, I suppose I could justify the higher price tag…as mentioned in the above paragraph, this simply isn’t the case.  To be fair, you can download a print and play version for free…though the developers estimate that it’ll cost about ten dollars to print everything and buy a box to contain it.  I didn’t have to time to fact check this estimate, though I’m sure savvy shoppers will find ways to beat it.In the end, “Cards Against Humanity” requires a lot of things to be successful.  First, you’ll need a group of adults.  Second, you’ll need a group of adults who occasionally act like kids.  Third, you’ll need a group of adults who have a sense of humor…a REALLY good sense of humor.  The more warped the sense of humor, the better.  Finally, you’ll need a group of adults who aren’t easily offended.  If you can satisfy these requirements and don’t mind the price tag, then you’ll find “Cards Against Humanity” to be an outstanding party game.  The more folks playing, the better.  It’s best to keep the kids away from this one, due to the adult content listed on the majority of the cards.  I’m looking forward to giving this a go during our next family get-together, just to see how other people I know respond to it.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OKZ06CI8NXN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"January 5, 2014","Casey D.","-","-","Game is hilarious when you play with a group","I was really excited when I first ordered this game set of Cards Against Humanity. I was a little disappointed however, when I received the box in the mail, as I anticipated that the box would be larger (like the size of a regular Apples to Apples game). Instead, you get one compact box and it contains the black and white cards (Black being the questions and the white cards being the answers). The content of the cards is hilarious when you get a group of no-good nicks around, and is a sure fire way to get a party started between a group of friends after a few drinks! SO, I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because: 1. I anticipated the box to be a bit bigger and 2. a couple of the cards in the deck were not cut right (a portion of the black color was on the white card). Other than that: good game for a group of 6+ people.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VUVES1CG2Q7X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

This is NOT the kind of game for people who are sensitive to jokes and such and is recommended NOT to play with those kind of people.I gave the Expansion Packs one through four the same rating. It's not a perfect game because it's not always appropriate to bring out the cards, but when it is; its damn exciting. I say, the more cards the better. Nothing brings a smile to my face than ' Elderly Japanese Men: kid-tested; Mother approved'","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPZWF2A84V13G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

The two and three play black cards are the best and really are what make the game interesting.I wish there was a little more variety in the white cards however, I think 1/3rd of those cards are sex related.  These can be funny the first time you see them but get stale after awhile.  The game is at its best for me when people make a clever plays with the more mundane cards like 'a really cool hat' or 'christmas cards with no money in them'.  But its still a fun game and I am sure the expansion packs will keep me coming back for more.Also, if  you are playing with fewer than 6 people I highly recommend the Rando Cardassian variant in the rulebook!","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHIDA8WJMZXJ6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"December 24, 2013","alexisj3","-","-","Best the first time, too many duplicate cards","The first time I played this game I laughed until my ribs hurt. I think the funniest part is the 'shock factor' of many of the cards. After that the game is still entertaining, but it's never like the first time you played. I really like the 'pick two' cards because the combinations become more unique and unpredictable.If you think this game may offend you, it probably will. It's not something that should be played in the presence of children or with your church group. The game is racist, sexist, and vulgar. But, it is more about the players than the cards. For example, during one of our games 'the blood of Jesus Christ' was played on 'Good to the last drop'. Separately those cards aren't offensive but, when a player decided to lay them together they became incredibly offensive. So, carefully choose who you play this game with as some people will definitely find it offensive. Part of the fun of the game is discovering who the most horrible person is (you may be surprised)!My biggest complaint about the game is the massive amount of duplicates in the box. I really don't think the game should contain any duplicate cards. This becomes especially annoying when the same card is laid by two players in the same hand. If it weren't for this I would have rated this a 5 star product.I hear that adding the expansion packs and taking out some of the cards you don't find funny or the duplicates really makes this game great. So, that's what I’m planning on doing. We already threw out the black card that read 'What is the most emo?' because we thought it was stupid.Overall, It's a good game and I will continue to play!","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9GZS957NYDJP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"November 30, 2013","Dave W","-","yes","I feel dirty playing this.","This game is hilarious if you are A.) with friends/family of equal humor, B.) drunk, and/or C.) a bad person.  If you don't fit in 2 or more of those categories, you will probably hate this game.  You'd be better off with Apples to Apples.Some thoughts:- The subject matter is very mature and caters solely to the perverse cynic in all of us.- The cards are made of a very high quality cards stock and are easy to read in high contrast black & white.- The surface of the cards has a chitin layer that protects against liquid spilling (see requirement B above).- The game is horribly boring with fewer than 4 people. Recommend 5-6 people for maximum fun.I really enjoyed playing this with my wife, brother & sister in law.  They aren't quite as dirty-minded as me, so I think I enjoyed it more than they did, but they certainly liked it.  The price is fair considering the developer allows you to print and make your own for free (they even tell you how and give you the template to download).  The expansions are available for a modest $10 so that's a great thing.I just wish I didn't feel like such a terrible person after playing it.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29MZIJGARQOZU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

It's downright nasty but I knew that going in so I am not complaining!This is a fun game...It compares to Apple-to-Apples, but the combination of cards can make it rather disgusting/politically incorrect/etc.  If you are shy about sex, drugs and political topics, don't buy this.The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the longevity: 8 people played the game for 1.5 hours and went through the entire answer deck, only to have to shuffle and replay the cards.  Many of the rounds consist of having to answer the questions with 2 and sometimes 3 cards which can tear through the deck rather quickly.We lowered the in-hand card requirement from 10 to 7 so that the cards would last.  It also seems like having 10 options for a response is a little high and mundane.  Some cards just end up 'cold' and that dulls the game.They also make expansion sets for this game and that is another reason why it gets 4 stars: It seems like they make the initial game with too few cards so that you purchase an expansion pack.  I wish they would make the base game just a little bigger so that you can play it for longer than 1.5 hours without getting bored.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BM2NXJTORTGC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

The cards seem to be high quality and printed well though very basic in their printing (no designs, fancy colors, not that you need that).  We definitely had a few good laughs playing with about 10 people for maybe 90 minutes or so.  But even in that short of a time span we were already running across repeats.  This could could get old very quick with large groups or playing it frequently, thus the numerous expansion packs for sale.  The expansion packs are more than twice as much per card so expanding the game could get expensive.  So it is a great game that if you got it out once a year or less for family gatherings/parties could be blast, but if you played this weekly or monthly it would get old fast.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKCJ7Q889NP5M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"October 9, 2015","Lipstick.Vigilante","-","-","Mr. Clean behind you","Great game to play with friends! Wouldn't recommend it for the younger crowd but great for adults! The premise of the game is that the dealer chooses a white card that states different scenarios and the other players either fill in the blanks with the black cards in their hands that have silly sayings on them and then turn them in to the dealer anonymously in hopes that their card(s) will be chosen by the dealer for whatever reason they choose. I usually go for the most ridiculous scenarios created by my friends which is also affected by how much alcohol I've consumed. I would also recommend purchasing the expansion packs they release since you'll want to play this game all the time and it will get boring after a while when you get the same scenarios over and over.

I don't think I've ever laughed as hard in my life as I have while playing this game, many times. As other reviews suggest, it's not really for kids because it's a little inappropriate. I agree with this. But nevertheless, this game is great and will provide you many hours of entertainment. People will want to play this game when you have a get together. The only thing about this game is that it gets kind of old after a while. I have played this game a lot, and after you've heard the cards about three or four times, they start to not be funny anymore. You know all of them and you know what could be funny, so it's hard to top that. The way to combat this is to get the expansions. Yes it's more money, but it is definitely worth it. Also, what I've just recently discovered through playing with other peoples' sets is that the base sets of this game are not all the same. Some of them come with different cards. This was a very pleasant surprise to me. So, if you want to make this game even more fun, get your friends to get it, or buy multiple sets, and use a different set each time.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BMO3O8NI1AW7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

I will say that we've played this maybe a dozen times, and it's not the go-to game like it used to be. I've heard expansion packs go a long way, but if we lose interest after ten games or so, I'm not sure I'd buy them, either. If you've never played it before and you're not easily offended, buy it.

Glad I didn't print it out myself as I prefer the professional look (though I love that option).  Found out this is created by some guys in Chicago and turns out I'm only 3 degrees of separation from knowing them!  Played with friends around Christmas in Chicago and we had a blast.  Left it for my friends to play and they pulled it out again on NYE.  Only thing I would change is that there doesn't seem to be any way to 'win' the game - guess you just get drunk and silly.

It's a lot of fun, a great ice breaker (as long as you know the people around you are at least somewhat open to more questionable humor), and generally makes for a great party game. And it's really difficult to replicate without cards. Just be sure of your audience before breaking it out, because there's a lot of room to insult the wrong person.My only complaint - it needs some blank cards. There are a lot of things I'd love to add to these cards that are specific to my friend group, but can't.

I would recommend you get the expansions as they will help to keep the game fresh and give you the option to create your own cards.

Great game to play with friends you know very well, as you can try and predict who would say what and see how well you really know how dark their sense of humor goes. The nice part though is that it is still hilarious to get to know other through this game. Great way of making everyone so uncomfortable they become comfortable, this game doesn't break the ice, it shatters it and throws it across the room. The mechanics are in the description so I won't bore you with them but know it plays as it should, the rules are easy to understand and there are enough cards here so the game won't get boring anytime soon. Despite that, the company seems to have released expansions just in case you've been playing this game nightly (which I might understand). If this game is in stock, get it immediately!

I was told it was just like Apples to Apples, but a more adult version. I heard great things about Cards against Humanity, but, until I played the game myself I didn't realize how perfect it was. A good time is guaranteed when playing this game. I have played it with friends and even family and we always have a blast. It's addictive.  The cards are hilarious and quirky and it's so easy to play, however, everyone in my group decides to skip over the 'pick two' cards because it is too difficult to read them in a specific order and try to conceal the identity of the person who has played the cards, especially if there is a large group of people playing. Some of the cards make absolutely no sense which makes it all the more hilarious and fun to play. After a while the cards get old. I recommend buying the expansion packs to add to the fun. I really enjoy this product and will continue to play every chance I get.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OLNXEW43BUZO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Never laughed harder!It's an adult version of Apples to Apples but allows the players to be more sick and twisted with their answers. This it's not for anyone who is easily offended. Does have a potential for people to answer with racial slurs, so only have those play who have a good sense of humor and can take it in stride.Don't like the multiple blanks on one card...kinda makes it more complicated to read answers and also more time for that round. The developer should have stuck to one liners and simple fill in a blank. Something like...my secret super power is.? And 'blank', high five, bro! Also, for those who play who are not all knowing with regards to street culture lingo, definitions should be on the cards. There are some really strange and obscure references.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGXYNYOE93OEJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"January 22, 2015","Hunter","-","yes","A party game for nearly all people","Card's Against Humanity's tagline is 'A party game for horrible people' is undoubtedly the easiest way to describe this ridiculous and fantastic card game. Drawing inspiration from Mattel's 'Apples to Apples', the game is played by a judge or 'Card Czar' (determined by who had pooped most recent in the group playing) placing a white card that states a prompt or phrase, and the players placing down relevant and random black cards that range from ludicrous to wildly inappropriate. Whoever the judge favors that round wins, and the process starts anew with a new judge.The black cards are mostly hilarious, and the white cards are funny enough on their own. The combination of the two creates a unique environment that will have all the players laughing for hours.The only design flaw of the game is the limited content. Obviously nothing can be limitless, but I've found that after anywhere between 10 to 15 games with the minimum four people, most combinations have either been discovered or have already lost their shock value. Luckily, there are a large variety of expansion packs, both official and unofficial, that can remedy this problem.I'd like to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys inappropriate humor, games that can bring an entire family together, and laughing in general. It's a great game overall, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36DQI98L1WYT6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

I knew it involved tasteless humor when I bought it for my 16 year old daughter to play with her friends and I thought I would be okay with it.  Yet, after playing it, I somewhat regret buying it for her.  I'm not a prude, but many of the sexual references are a bit graphic for my taste.  It was not practical for me to review every single card before she played it, but man, now there are a few I would like to pull out of the deck before she plays it again.  I'd say about 80% is okay for high school students.  This compares to Apples to Apples, as Family Guy compares to the Simpsons.  That said, the gang loves to play it.

I completely understand that in the right context, any card can be funny, but when I draw a 'science' or 'flightless birds' card, there is no way I'll get picked over the more shocking or grotesque ones.When someone wins a round with horrendous cards like 'opposable thumbs', please let me know.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3243WFAZ8QM2R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

That being said, I would like to just warn people considering this game of two things.  First, the cards aren't of the highest quality.  So consider making your own cards if you can't find these cards at a decent price.  Secondly, once you DO get the cards, I recommend that you take it account the people you are playing with.  There may be some cards you may need to screen ahead of time due to tragic life events like deaths in the family.

All in all, super fun and entertaining and I would definitely recommend buying it and bringing it with you whenever you're going to a friends place because you can never go wrong with it, unless you're offended by hearing, 'And the Academy Award for not giving a s*** about the Third World goes to God.'","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHCEPEHSQEVPZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"November 2, 2014","A Pinch of Lavender","-","-","they're not as funny as first time or two","OMG! I have laughed so hard, and been laughed at so hard, my stomach hurts. I have also proven how prudish I am, my adult kids are much more fluent in many subjects that I've never even heard of. Have to admit that there are moments of stunned embarrassment as well. Play with people you know, people you know who can handle extreme off-color subjects, and language. And prep each game with the same info, players need to know that they can't be offended by the offensive info. A real oxymoron, but in an underhanded way, it's even educational!  The only thing I've found somewhat discouraging is, once you've gone through all the cards, they're not as funny as first time or two.  And probably why the company has become so successful in providing additional game packs to add to the initial box.  4 stars substantiates my cautionary message, and boredom with the same game...need to find new victims, I mean friends, to play with....or buy add-on packs...","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QF77VPBR3UU3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"August 16, 2013","Trepidation","-","-","Over the top fun.","The only reason I'm docking it to four stars instead of five is that this is utterly, totally inappropriate for not only most age groups, but also a whole lot of cultures and subcultures. There are so many in jokes and American pop culture references that, no matter who you are, you're likely to find a few that just don't make sense.This is a shameless Apples to Apples clone that adds in so much horrifying profanity and grotesquely sexual innuendo that, in exactly the manner it was intended, it's shocking even to most 20-somethings. If you're unfamiliar with the game's origins, it was designed as a dorm game, which is eminently clear as soon as you've played a round or two.That said: For people in their 20's and 30's who have been reasonably plugged in to internet and media culture over the last decade or so, this game is absolutely hilarious. Expect zero subtlety and make sure you have a few bottles of something strong handy, and this will likely become a staple of your party gaming.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23L3RJJPC8BWY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"January 30, 2014","Jose Monsanto","-","-","Great party game!","The night I told my friends that the Cards came in, it was on!  We all got together at the kitchen table and had a blast.  Myself being the only one who had not played before was rolling on the floor after hearing the crazy and messed up combinations these people came up with... but I was not alone!Any who, why was one star knocked off for a game that brings so much laughter?  Duplicates... there were so many duplicates; one round we had people lay down two of the same card while I was personally holding a copy in my hand (I wondered if anyone else had the same card in their hand).  I love that it looks as though you are getting a whole bunch of original and Krazy cards in the box but the time I need to spend to sort out the duplicates is just annoying.  I will post a pic of all the duplicate cards when I pick my deck back up (it's currently on loan, bringing filth and good laughter to others).  and if you have not yet, go PLAY this game!  You learn a bit about how messed up your friends are and a lot about how your mind works as well.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V11ZYNZ83J6H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
