"December 27, 2018","Anita G Doran","-","yes","It’s not really funny","It’s just not very funny, compared to Relative Insanity. (Just wrote a review of that—5 stars.) The cards that are funny are also grossly filthy, and I’m no prude. I played with 4 other people, all in our 60’s, all well-educated professionals. We were trying to figure out what demographic it would appeal to. Too many of the cards were just “duh” stupid, or extremely serious. What can possibly be funny about “Child abuse” ??  I bought Relative Insanity for someone else as a requested gift. I bought CAH at the same time just because I had heard so much about it. I am sorry I wasted my money. I’ll buy Relative Insanity for our game nights, and am seriously thinking about returning CAH because it is just not that funny.","1","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YZV02GETJJB2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"October 31, 2015","ShepherdWay","-","yes","Not for our friends","First of all, this game is intended for adults. Secondly, this game involves a zero IQ with incessant sexual content that becomes lackluster within minutes. To be open minded, I shared the cards with about a dozen people (between 24-65) and censed their opinion. To my surprise, no one found it interesting. We enjoy games but this one is simply too strange.","1","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NP6S7AMOZ3S5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"April 2, 2016","Lisi","-","yes","Nope-Nope-Nope","This wasn't as spectacular as reviews made it seem. We played this with 30 yr olds, 20 yr olds and 18 & 19 year olds. Sure, you may get the occasional funny lines/combinations, but it wasn't continuous. We aren't serious people, we joke around, have fun, we all have a sense of humor and some of us have a dark sense of humor but this game isn't worth the hype. Unless you're drinking or, on some drug, this game is not a 'non-stop full of laughs' nights. You must be on that 'everything is so funny' mood to find this game hilarious.","1","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17OQ0XIKR8X4W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"November 11, 2018","greenerk","-","yes","The ultimate definition of "SALACIOUSNESS"","In my opinion, the apparent popularity of this game is an indication as to how low the moral standards of appropriate humor has become in America (for some).  I witnessed the game being played one night, and as a 67 yr. old retiree, I was shamed by the compromise of nominal Christians & non laughing at having to choose between 2-6 salacious alternatives. I actually couldn't distinguish Believers from non. Our relatives actually fought & gave their lives for this nation so that others could dredged down entertainment to such depravity?  Could a child ever be present during such a game while his/her parent indulge in such indecency?  I think not. Isn't this a game any decent parent would want to protect your child from.

"April 2, 2019","Abel Jones","-","-","Degenerate Poison Befitting a Degenerate Culture and Nation","This game is very representative of the United States and the West broadly at this juncture in history.  It is purely degenerate poison and disgusting simply for the sake of disgusting.  The people who made this game are fine representatives of their tribe which rules America and blasts constant degenerate poison into the culture via television, Hollywood, and all other forms of entertainment to even include board games, card games, and video games.  The purpose is to degrade the populace and make us a twisted and bloated caricature of what God intended us to be.  In short, the purpose is to make us into what they believe we are - disgusting animals.Just like with Hollywood and all the technologies involved in mass media, these creatures did not create anything special or unique.  They are not creative, perhaps even being incapable of creativity.  They merely use money to buy, take over, and corrupt industries created by their host culture.  They are destroyers and quite proud of that fact, even bragging about it continuously.This game is a straight rip off of Apples to Apples, only with degenerate poison in place of relatively benign pop culture references.  Nobody but degenerates should play this game (and if you partake of things such as this you will eventually become a degenerate).  It is not fit for families, children, or young people.  Only those already corrupted by degenerate popular culture and mass media (TV, Hollywood) will enjoy this game.  Certainly no Christian or moral person should purchase this game.","1","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TC0OK0C6IKBZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
