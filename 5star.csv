"November 16, 2017","Not Offended","-","yes","Operation Get My Family Back","This game is so much fun.  I played it with 3 generations family last weekend.  I've been fearful of us drifting apart.  Usually the adult nephews are bored and ready to bolt.  Everybody has to be 'someplace.'  I had reservations about playing this game w my mom and her grandsons so I pulled maybe 30 of the most 'horrible' cards but after about 20 min I started shuffling them in.  We as a family haven't laughed and enjoyed each others' company in a VERY long time.  After 2 hours flashed past more than one face hurt from laughing.We like to think highly of ourselves but by the end the consensus was yup, we really are horrible people.  Funny but THAT bonded us.  Looking forward to Thanksgiving and I'm not the only one.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28NNQ80PR8MM4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"October 30, 2018","Michael E. Corby","-","yes","Hilarious. The kids will want to play.","This is recommended for ages 17+. I brought it to a family dinner, knowing that the two kids, ages 11 and 14, would vacate to the basement after dinner to play on their computers. The somewhat precocious 14-year-old overheard that I had Cards Against Humanity and made it clear that while he had never played or even seen the game, he knew enough about it that he wanted to play if his parents would give him permission. They did, and what ensued was hilarity, but even better, it opened channels for discussion about sex, politics, justice, racism, homophobia and all the things that exist in society, and when things are funny and when they are not. What made breakthrough shows like South Park and The Simpsons funny when they premiered was their seeming inappropriateness, but they too broached topics that ought to be discussed by parents and children. In an age when information is available 24/7, along with misinformation, this may be the opportunity for families who value open discussion, education and critical thinking to open the door to those discussions. There's so much for parents to teach to and learn about their kids, and to a degree, vice-versa. It's not for everyone, but this family found it hilarious and vital. I wish there had been a way to have these discussions with parents or another responsible adult when I was a young teenager and had to find out what I could from a 1957 Encyclopedia Brittanica and a Webster's Dictionary.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22EVI4OAL73PK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"January 2, 2016","Ash MarksTM","-","yes","Must have for every party or adult game night.","It's fairly common knowledge that this game is very offensive. So if you're easily offended, it's a no brainier that this is not the game for you. Lots of sexual cards, a bit of Holocaust 'humor' cards, and there are even a card or two in there mentioning pedophilia. My husband has a pretty obscene sense of humor, but even we had to take out some cards (mostly the pedophilia cards, and he doesn't like the ones mocking God or Jesus.) The game is amazing, though, so it's not really a big deal at all to toss 5 or 6 cards that go to far for us. There are PLENTY more to chose from that are still ridiculous and entertaining, especially if you go into the expansion packs.All we have to do is mention having this game at a party or get together and immediately dozens of hands fly up when we ask if anybody wants to play, or tons of 'I WANT TO PLAY!'s are shouted at the simply mention of having the game. It's especially entertaining to play with normally more reserved old ladies... because then the truth really comes out, and you find their just as disgusting a person as you are haha","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RR31LK9GU02H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"October 29, 2014","Paul Gomez","-","yes","This game is just f***ing great!","Ever wondered what a grown-up version of Apples to Apples would look like? Well, Cards Against Humanity is the perfect response to that desire.If you've never played Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, let me fill you in on how CAH works. There are Black Cards and there are White Cards. At the start of each round, one chosen player (The Judge) will select a Black Card from the stack. On these cards will be a phrase or question that needs to be answered/completed. This is where white cards come in. Players have 10 White Cards, which they use to complete the Black Card's question(s)/blank(s). After each player (besides The Judge) has chosen the best White Card in their hand to go with the Black Card, all players turn their White Cards in to The Judge. From here, The Judge reviews the White Cards and decides his/her favorite pairing of the White and Black Cards. The player who played the Judge's chosen White Card gets a point (if that matters to your group) and the gameplay starts all over.Let me give you an example with word-for-word examples of what you'll find on the Black and White cards.1. The Judge plays a Black Card that says: 'Life for the Native Americans was forever changed after the white man introduced them to ____________.'2. All players (exc. the Judge) choose a White Card.3. After everyone has chosen their White Card, the Judge reviews the responses: 'Smallpox Blankets', 'Drinking Alone', 'A Can of Whoop-Ass', and 'Take-Backsies'(Before you read these and think I'm an awful person, these are actual White Cards that I have seen played on the aforementioned Black Card)4. The Judge chooses 'Drinking Alone' and the player who picked this White Card wins the round.This game is great fun, but keep in mind that there are some edgy/racy/raunchy/explicit/graphic/vulgar White and Black cards. In fact, that's the point.If you don't have the right sense of humor to laugh at a card combination like 'Lifetime presents: __Pretending to Care__, the story of __Not Giving a S*** about the Third World__', then this is not a game that I would recommend for you.This is not a children's game, and this is not a game to play with Grandma (unless Grandma has a really effed up and awesome sense of humor). But if you and your friends enjoy laughing at the darker side of life, art, and pop culture... This is the perfect game for your next party.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X4FBU61D9XSF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"July 11, 2016","Divalalake","-","yes","Non-stop laughter and groans...  Simple fun for a gathering of the right (or wrong) people.","I've been hearing so much about this game, and I love opportunities to do things together with a good group of people.  So, I finally decided to buy this game.  It was everything I hoped and more!  The rules are fairly simple, and it didn't take long for the group of us to understand the premise of the game and then to truly embrace it.  The game doesn't tell you when a person has, 'won' so we decided after playing for over an hour that we should stop when someone reached 10 points.  We had a small group this time, just four of us.  And because it was our first time, we didn't use any of the recommended variations to the game.  And I don’t currently have any of the many expansion packs.  The rules are simple, find the best (or worst possible) words to fill in the blank for a phrase, or to answer a question.  The power to decide who provided the best answer is in the hands of one person and it rotates each turn.  There are lots of possible answers, and a decent amount of “questions” which is where I think all of the expansion decks must come in handy.  The cards are the same stock as a good set of playing cards.  So, that makes shuffling them fairly easy to do.  In all, it was definitely worth the money and I can’t wait to play again.  We even had a laugh over the inspection tag that was located in the box.  It’s NOT your standard tag.  I’m already planning a get together so I can get friends together to play.  I paid full price for this game, and did not receive any discount.  These are my unbiased opinions.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15G3TTMUF4OU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"March 28, 2016","Sean and Heather Gilliland","-","yes","Hilarious yet wrong....so wrong.","If you like to laugh, and you don't take life too seriously then you will likely enjoy this game.  If you are the type to be easily offended I would RUN, because this is likely the most offensive game you will ever play.  I mean the name 'Card's against humanity' kinda hints at that though.  You will feel like you need a preacher, some holy water, to wach your mouth out with soap etc. after making some of the choices you make in this game.  You will feel even MORE guilty laughing your BOOTY off at it.  It's wrong.  Oh so wrong....yet so right.  You learn a lot about a person's humor when playing this game.  That is part of the concept actually.  If you are good at reading people you will quickly learn the patterns of a person's decision making.  Some people like to choose the 'best fit', some like to choose anything that has to do with bodily functions, Some like to choose the most random answer possible and some will choose anything that has an animal involved.  You will learn this about people (hopefully) and be able to customize your 'answers' to give yourself a better chance at winning.  That leaves me with the 'CONCEPT' of the game.  It's pretty easy.  Everyone gets a set number of answer cards that they do not show anyone.  Then one at a time someone will read a question card.  everyone (other than person asking the question), is then to put down the best answer to that question from the cards they have in their hand.  The person who asked the question then reads them all out loud (this is where you will CRY laughing at some of the answers) and then selects which card they feel is best.  Whoever placed that card down gets a point.  Most points in the end wins.  Simple, silly, fun.  Don't play with your grandmother unless she is a dirty, dirty lady ;-)The box is small so it is an easy game to bring to a party or on vacation.  It is easy to store away and pull out for an instant drinking game and fun time (with the right crowd obviously).","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GL06V6FPLPJV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"December 26, 2018","TGG18","-","yes","Great for storing all your cards and expansion packs together","I gave this box to my boyfriend for Christmas after he had received the Green, Red and Blue expansion packs. It got to be annoying to have all those boxes laying around. I thought it would be nice to have all the cards together in one place and to be able to shuffle them all together.  So far, he has the original gamoe pack, the Red Box, Blue Box, Green Box, Jew Pack, one of the Christmas Packs, Period Pack and Dad Pack. You can see from the pictures that those take up a little over half of the box all together. It's really nice having them all in one box and makes it much easier to travel with.It comes with 50 blank cards that we will probably never use. We would have preferred those to be additional cards with sayings already on them, but they didn't ask us when designing it. However, it does also come with 20 cards that have sayings on them.There is an additional hidden card in the lid of the box that is pretty amazing. I don't like that you have to cut or tear the paper of the lid to get it out but it doesn't seem to bother my boyfriend. I just think it's kinda ugly now, but definitely worth getting that card out!I'm now reading that there is an additional hidden card in the bottom of the box that we missed. I will have to check that out and see if I can find it and report back.I'm not sure what else I can say about a box.  It does not come with the original CAH game. It's simply an empty storage box for the game and expansion packs. If you plan to add on to the original CAH game, I definitely recommend purchasing this box to store them all in.**UPDATE**After looking for that additional hidden card, I'm here to report we found it! If you look in the bottom of the box, where the cards are stored, the extra card is hidden in the the bottom of the center compartment. I'm sorry but I did not snap a picture but you can Google it online if you're having troubles locating it.I also realized that we never mixed in the 20 expansion cards that came with the Bigger Blacker Box. They all have sayings with the word 'box' in them. (No, not that 'box') They're actually pretty lame considering they are from CAH who have made some pretty hilarious cards.  They say things like, 'In a box' and 'A box within a box' etc... We didn't find them funny and have never used them or ever plan to.","5","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718FpBRJvkL._SY88.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GnJP0wgIL._SY88.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71b1FfPEnQL._SY88.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nt15w7uWL._SY88.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LYRR6TCNYNTJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"September 11, 2018","Adam B. Bugay","-","yes","With Cards Against Humanity, anything goes and I guarantee you hilarity will ensue! Highly recommended!","This is one hilariously fun, adult themed card game that will generate tons of laughs and will be your go to party game for your future endeavors. It's moderately priced at around $25 via Prime, but the price of admission was totally worth it for me and my friends.Overview:Cards Against Humanity is a party game for adults where players try to win the favor of the current “Card Czar” by playing a white card that answers the question or completes the statement posed by a black card. The outcome is usually hilarious, with tons of possible outcomes!Positives:- Great game for a group of 4 or more players. Generally the more players the better.- Little to no downtime.- The game is extremely simple to pick up and play.- There is a large variety of cards, both white and black, so the game is very replayable with tons of possibilities.- One of the funnest, most hilarious party games that I have ever played, and is the perfect option for parties/college/etc.Negatives:- You will need at least four people to play this title. Any less and the game becomes a little boring.- This is not a game for youngsters or up tight folks, recommended 18+ here.- The standard set costs around $25, and add-ons will set you back another $20 for each set.I simply love this card game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a go to party game option for 18+ individuals looking to have a great time.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR2Q4U62BLUCU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"April 25, 2016","Jess Me","-","yes","Oddly Charming","This is rude, crude, and I absolutely love it! It has been a hit with friends and family members. My mom even played, and laughed her butt off.  Great game to just sit around and share many, many, laughs with each other!  This is a guaranteed game when getting together!I have played this Cards Against Humanity so many time since my purchase, and you would think that without purchasing any other expansions by now it would become boring and repetitive, but not at all. I have played many times with the same people, and we laugh all night.  The initial question to begin the game is the icebreaker every time; you would have to be a fly on the wall to see how crazy it is for us to determine who goes first! There may be other influences while playing, but the game recommends outside influences anyway!  We have even adapted to be a drinking game from time to time, whatever floats your boat on this. No limitations or restrictions, other than having a great time with the people around you.  My Aunt played recently; she is pushing the age somewhere between 65-70 years old.  She did better than anyone else sitting there.  She sat down, and brought her A-game for a first timer!  She had some of the funniest comebacks!  It was absolutely hilarious and painfully funny.  Tears...tears of constant painful laughter.  This is seriously a game anyone with an open mind can enjoy, and those 'stick in the muds' will be discovered sitting somewhere sulking. Anyone can have fun with this; you just have to give it a chance! Cards Against Humanity is a hit with every friendly event!","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRX6OU3SDTJ0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

This game has been great for smaller or bigger get togethers and we have really had alot of fun with this game.. I also love how they have expansion packs as well.. The game is very easy to learn and play and you can choose to play as long as you would like or have time for. This is a game thats dirty and raunchy and they are right can be awkward yet hilarious. This is not a game for those who cant let their hair down and have a good time..  But for those of us who can this is totally worth it and provides hours of entertainment and laughter! There isnt many peices.. just white and black cards.. One person reads the black card which is a question, and the rest of the players simply choose one their white cards in their hands that may fit what the black card read. Overall Great game, give it a try or gift as a gift!!!!","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R214Z6DO8URG7O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"October 5, 2015","Jo","-","yes","Gut-clenching Fun.","This is, hands down, one of the best games I've ever played. I'm not just talkin' about card games, either. I mean all games.Every couple of months when I have one of my house parties, Cards Against Humanity is pulled off the shelf and played. My guests end up with stomach cramps by the time they leave, from all of the side-splitting laughter that goes on during the game. But the momentary pain is worth it. Plus, gut-busting laughter is a great way to burn off some calories from all those PBRs and microbrews we were drinking.If you don't care about having a nice display box or the beautiful glossy thick official cards, the guys who made C.A.H. give you the option to print out a free copy from their website. I did that initially, out of impatience and anticipation. The card stock self-printed version works, but I eventually upgraded to the official set. I felt better giving some money back to the geniuses who invented this game anyway. It's well worth the price. I've even brought it to friends' parties and never failed to have at least a couple people convinced to buy their own copy by the time the night was done and we all turned into fat gluttonous pumpkins.The game is perfect with around five to nine people playing. Anything less than that just won't offer as many funny scenarios. Anything more than that and each round becomes more tedious for the main card holder. But still, it works with a larger or smaller number than my suggestion.Plus, there are now extensions available for the game! Woot!A word of advice: this game is incredibly un-politically correct. It is definitely not for the squeamish of character, weak of heart, or those who don't have a stomach for profanity or hedonism. You have to have an open-minded sense of humor to use this game to its fullest capabilities. And if you do, you're going to love it.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF32TS3GCARZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"February 15, 2016","Ali Cheming","-","yes","Unlike any game I've ever had (1 year later)","Overall one of the best games I've had. I'm a college student and it's super fun to have in the dorms. Met a lot of new people freshman year because I owned this and people would come over with their friends to borrow it. I also recommend playing this in pairs so two people are on a team and they choose a card to put forth. Found this to be much more fun.APPROPRIATE AGE + GIFTING:This game has a lot of terms that would be inappropriate for children or preteens (depending on the teen). I would generally recommend this for people 16+. Wouldn't really recommend parents to get this for their kids for Christmas or something since it is inappropriate and may be weird if it was from a parent/relative. Definitely a terrific gift to give a friend or yourself!STILL FUN AFTER A YEAR:I really liked Apples to Apples, which is why I got this. I tried playing Apples to Apples again after having this for a year and it's not even fun anymore compared to this haha. I will say that I've played this multiple times and it continues to be fun, but novel cards are the most interesting. Cards against Humanity offers expansion packs for a reasonable price so those that play a lot can continue to get new cards. I haven't bought any of these yet and still find the game to be fun. It really depends on who you play with!","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJKZL5SQ6C28F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

It is a guaranteed game changer on how the night is going to go.*NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS* We love to have people over for dinner and parties and this game always ends up coming out.  It brings everyone around, interacting with one another and always brings a lot of laughs.I guess you could compare this with Apples to Apples for adults... I think this more falls on the lines of 'Jackass'.I have had the 'wonderful' opportunity to play this three times with my parents, and twice with my father in law. I don't know what it is but I always end up pulling the card, 'what are my parents hiding for me.' Seriously, NO I don't want to play that card.  My parents end up throwing the best, but most inappropriate cards down.  It ends up making my dad laugh so hard his whole body turns red and cries. That in itself people is why we play this game.  There not much else that can make adults laugh and have so much fun over dinner.*Disclaimer: If you do not like to have fun, don't buy this - it is not for you. JUST KIDDING, its hysterical.

We're all excited about playing again.  This game is definitely raunchy and edgy and irreverent and deliberately not at all P.C. .  It is most definitely for an all adult audience.  And it's not for the easily offended or those who are uncomfortable with being naughty or offensive or those who are going to take things too seriously.  Lots and lots of jokes that involve sex, bodily functions, race, religion, politics, etc.  While I think it's probably most fun for a smarter crowd to play (it leads to some really witty answers that way and less cards that people don't know what they mean), it's also easy enough as far as the game play goes that I think just about anyone could get the hang of it right off and have a good time playing.  It's simple enough,too, as far as the rules and format go, that you can totally play it when you've had a few drinks,too.  Even our guest who'd hit the bar the hardest was still totally a functioning player through the whole evening.  Yeah, he won less questions when he was wasted than earlier in the evening, but still wasn't so bad at it that it was distracting to the rest of us or took away from the pace or quality of the game.  We played with about 6-8 people and I feel like that was about the right amount.  You want lots of answers to pick from, but if you've got tons of people it might take too long.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2X1MIN00YC53G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

And especially do not order for kids and young teens. Honestly, you should probably know better.There’s many different cards and expansions to add to it, you just cannot get bored of it, ever. I’d recommend for people who love to laugh and definitely have a dark sense of humor. Many cards are really inappropriate with sexual connotations, but that’s just part of the game, you can choose to play them or not.You can expand on this beyond belief, because the company continues to come up with new expansions.And the cards are easy to clean and pretty hard to damage with liquid.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37UIH4XRXG1DI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

We played the game previously with my daughter and her boyfriend, and I was on the floor, laughing at some of the responses.Christmas Eve was hilarious, to say the least. It's always helpful to get the ice broken with a game like this, which is why the rules of the game are so incredibly brilliant.

Imagine my mother, who goes to church every week and waters the plants at the church and won't say more than 'darn' reading the cards aloud. Priceless.I brought the game to our friends' house for New Year's Eve. When I tell you that the game went from 'I hate this crap' to 'Hurry up, I want to hear the next question!', I knew we had a winner on our hands. My husband and I already knew the answers, so I went right out and purchased three expansion packs, so that we could be surprised by some of the white cards.Get the game, but if there are children present, wait until they go to bed before you break it out. If you're really shy, get your feet wet with 'Apples to Apples', but I was advised not to even waste my money, and to just buy this one. I'm so not sorry. I don't think you'll be, either, especially if you are a 'horrible person' like me, lol.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R109UF542Y08MJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"August 30, 2015","BTStarz","-","yes","Insanely Fun Game!","This game is extremely fun and a great party game! I bought the original set and the Extension Pack 1.The object of the game is for the 'player-in-charge', which rotates each round, to put down a card that often has a blank that needs to be filled in. Each player puts down a card that they feel best fills in the blank and answers the question, as well as what will appeal to the 'host's' personality the most. The host doesn't see who puts down what card. The host picks their favorite response, and the person who put down that card gets to collect the host's question card. The person who collects the most question cards wins.Many of these questions and answers are 'dirty', or not PC, so it is not a good idea to play with someone who is easily offended. The more players you have, the more fun the game is.This game is a study in character. You have to know something about each of the players' personalities and what types of responses would best appeal to them if you want the best shot at winning!","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ULS960R5MJBB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

By the way, those are far from the worst things you will hear. I kept it nice here. Figure out which kind of person you are. If that seems like something you would want to hear, then buy the game. If you do not want to hear grandma or someone else say such things, then stick to Apples to Apples.We used to cross out and write our own Apples to Apples cards to make it more depraved. Then this game came out. Well that just made me sad, I could have been rich. Damn it! Well I am sure I am not the only one who did it, but don't have to do it anymore.

"July 16, 2014","David Lundy","-","yes","I'd like to say that I'm a nice person","First off, I'd like to say that I'm a nice person.  I try not to be prejudiced, mean, or otherwise demeaning to other people.  It's just how I roll.  That said, sometimes you just have to turn off the filter and let 'er rip.  Find a group of like-minded people who are willing to be raunchy, mean, nasty, and generally un-politically correct and play this game.  As long as 'what's said in the game, stays in the game', this game is fantastic.The premise is simple.  One person draws a black card with a question on it such as '____.  Kid tested, mother approved.'  Then, from a hand of 10 white cards, choose the 'best' answer to the question.  Your answers can be as benign as 'Peanut butter', 'thermonuclear war', or 'Rolando, Flatulist to the King' or non-PC such as 'Black People' or raunchy as 'Warm, velvety muppet sex' or even worse.This is where the game really shines.  The 'Best' answer is voted on by the person who read the question.  So if you play to your audience, you'll often 'win' the round.  The reader may not care for raunchy sexual innuendo, but may love ironic wordplay.  Or the person could be a flaming racist.  It's totally up to the reader what constitutes a 'winning' answer.  And while a lot of the cards are pretty horrible, there's many many many 'clean' answers that, when taken in the right context, are horrible in their own right.  And virtually every combination you come up with will be hysterical!This game is absolutely *not* for children, the closed-minded, or anyone who can't temporarily turn off their moral filter for a little while and just have fun.  If you enjoy just cutting loose with like-minded people and letting it all go crazy, then this is the game for you.  And, of course, a little alcohol goes a long way towards improving the quality of the play.  Make sure you get the expansions, too, as more is oh so much better.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6TW53GIB58C4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

As a bit of background, I am liberal in my political stance but pretty conservative in my everyday life, especially in the words I choose to use around my kids and in public. I rarely curse, ever, even with very mild words. But this game - when played with the right group of people - has given me the ability to let loose a bit and relax. I've played with couples of mixed races and gender combinations, as well as on a weekend girls' trip and it was an equally big hit. I DO feel like a terrible person sometimes when I give certain answers, but as long as everyone in the group understands that it's all in jest, this can be easily overlooked. Do NOT play this game with people who lack a sense of humor or who are ultra-conservative, politically or religiously.I have friends who play this with their adult parents or teenage kids, but I can't imagine myself doing so with either. And if you're a conservative parent, keep this out of your kids' reach; we attempted to play Pictionary with our neighbors one night with these cards (harder than it seems) and my 7-year-old walked in and picked up a black card, then started giggling, hard. I panicked before I saw what it said: 'My ex-wife', which is about as mild as any of the words on these cards get. We now keep them far out of reach and sight.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UX0GQS5014E7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

I enjoy playing it at college with my friends and at home with my cousins. This is not what I would consider a family friendly game, I have played with my mother, aunt, grandmother and cousins once and it was top four most awkward moments in my life. This game should be stuck to with people of the game ages or just not at family functions. There are some of the cards that make me feel uncomfortable but I usually set them off to the side and return with play. Many of the cards are very provocative or inappropriate and do not list the definitions of words.

There are black and white cards.The black cards have a sentence with a blank spot (or two). The white cards have a word that can be used to fill in the blanks. Everyone takes 10 white cards. The person who pooped last takes the first black card and reads the sentence out loud then the players put down the card they think would be the most appropriate (or not). Don't worry if you don't want to disclose your bathroom routine with your peeps, there is always a person proud to tell how regular he is. Besides, being first does not give you an advantage. It is just that the game has to start with someone.Then the person who drew the black card decides what card fits in the blank the best (or the funniest).  The person who had the best card is the next to draw a black card.

Hill","-","yes","Cards Against Humanity","What a relief to discard the facade and just be myself, and while doing so, have the pleasure of watching my friends shed their own layers of proper conduct. When permission is tacitly given – these are the rules of the game and must be followed -- it is amazing how quickly socially acceptable behavior/thinking freely drops away in search of the best punchline.Set up is fast and rules are minimal. The Card Czar (judge) holds a black card that contains a phrase needing completion. Each player has ten white cards, and selects one they think best finishes the phrase. The judge makes the final determination and that player wins the hand. The game is flexible to shorten or lengthen, etc.. Not a game for children.Am I a despicable person? I didn’t realize it before, but given my rude and unthinkable selections made during play, without question I am, but there is some comfort in the knowledge that my friends are horrible, too. It is difficult to get too upset about it because, as noted above, it was not within our control. We had to choose from the cards dealt – it wasn’t our fault.  Normally we would never… Well, maybe it was our fault, but so what.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YFMPVUQG4XHU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"May 25, 2014","Bonham","-","yes","It really is for "horrible" people.","Firstly, let me just say that I took some of the warnings about 'if you are easily offended' with a grain of salt.  I no longer do.  This game has 'answer' cards in it that I wouldn't even want to vaguely describe on a posted review on Amazon.  I've even considered implementing a house rule that says if you wouldn't feel comforting explaining what something is (if others don't know) you should probably swap that card out... because there are 'answer' cards in here that you more than likely would not want to have to explain to your parents (or have them explain to you).I have a group of very close, long time friends (going back as far as 30-35 years) so we can easily revert back to our immature years given the right circumstances.  This game has us laughing so hard we couldn't talk and/or were crying due to laughter.  The question of the night was 'But, before I kill you Mr Bond, I must show you ______'.  I don't think it would be appropriate to give the answer than won the round here (it was the one that had a few of us laughing so hard we had to pause the game momentarily).So, this game is freaking awesome, but if you don't find poop jokes or making fun of various things like ethnicity, minorities, sexual topics or religions occasionally funny you should probably avoid this game.  If you find ANYTHING AT ALL in this world too offensive to joke about, this game will probably offend you at SOME point.  For the rest of you horrible people, you'll be buying all the expansions (which I hear are even more over the top).You could play with as little as three people to as many as you like, but I would say an ideal number of people playing this game would be in the 6-8 range.  At least six, so you have five answers to choose from, however I think getting over eight people would make it a little more difficult to keep the game moving at a decent pace.  Lastly, as funny as this game can be, you probably don't want to play it ALL THE TIME, because I suspect the shock value of some of the cards would start to wear thin if played excessively.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VDN676TG2J4F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"June 13, 2014","Liquid_Peppermint","-","yes","Great way to win friends, influence people, and close the generation gap.","Warning: I have played this game only three times, and I didn't follow the rules any of those three times.However, each of the times I've played, it's been with different people, all of whom were more experienced than I.  My first game was with my sister.  It was just the two of us throwing cards at each other, and it resulted in quite a bit of hilarity. She shared about the time her husband had to explain to our mom what 'pixelated bukkake' was.  We laughed. We cried. It was warm and fuzzy.The other times were with friends.  Friends I didn't know too well.  At least, not until the end of the game.  By then it was pretty clear who was going to hell (all of us) and in which handbasket (not pretty ones).I learned more from this game than I did in high school.  I had no idea what Hutus and Tutsis meant when I first sat down to play. Even now that I know, I still giggle when I hear the words. The only mention of Aaron Burr I'd ever heard was on Big Daddy with Adam Sandler.  Having Wikipedia open on a nearby electronic device may help immensely when playing this game, so everyone doesn't have to admit they don't know what smegma means.Finally, if any word or mention in this review offends you in any way, please avoid this game.  This game is not for you.  It's not for everyone.  I would not, for instance, invite the 90 year old WWII veteran next door to play.  I wouldn't invite the folks across the street with sixty-four grandkids and a sign stating 'ABORTION STOPS A BEATING HEART' who asked me my mother's name so they could pray for her (and presumably me) to play.  I MIGHT invite the nosy hobag next door who acts shocked and pearl-clutchy at everything to play, just to see the look on her face (and maybe thwart future visits to pry into my personal life).

I've found it more fun playing with people you know quite well, but it's also a riot at parties where you may not know everyone as well; guaranteed you'll have a much deeper understanding of them after busting this out.  We laughed so hard, all night -  the gut-busting, deep belly laughter that makes a fat girl like me realize the next day what stomach muscles really are ( and where they are -  so sore in the belly and jaw the next day!)  I've purchased all four expansion packs, as well as the bonus xmas edition from 2012, and cannot say enough good things about this game. My son and even his co-workers have asked to borrow this, it's wicked good fun. Not for the faint of heart, this is for people who are not offended easily, but the title should express that well enough.  If you've clicked on the link based on the title, you're halfway to being the kind of person this was designed for. If you've read the reviews and are even considering the purchase?  Do it, do it now.  RIght now.  You will NOT be sorry.  Also, the guys who print this game are really, really effing cool -  read a little about Cards Against Humanity LLC and you'll see what I mean.  ( For instance, donating the entire profit from the xmas edition in 2012 -  I mean, what companies DO that in this day and age?  They also make this free to print for anyone that wants to and has the capability.  Again, who would DO that in this day and age?)  Winners in my book all the way around -  I'll purchase every flipping extension pack they offer.*****  EDIT  *****  OK, folks -  8228 reviews, and only 178 that have three stars or fewer. Do the math, people; more than 97% of reviewers gave this 4 or 5 stars. These are excellent odds.  I suspect the lower ratings are from people that really didn't know what they were getting into, then found the game offensive.

Alas, I felt the need to own this and play it no matter where I go, so I bought it here. Obviously this isn't a game for children, though it will bring out your child-like wonder of awesomeness trying to come up with either the most heinous or humorous answer to the already outrageous questions. If you think the price is a little too steep for you, keep in mind that not only will this be a game that you can use as a unique conversation starter, but you can play over and over due to the sheer amount of answer cards there are.

Seriously, we've played it twice, all the way through the box of cards each time and I cried both times.  Mascara running down the cheeks type of laughter, can't catch your breath and have to walk away from the table type of laughter.It's so simple.  There's a black card in the center of the table.  ('What did my grandmother find deeply disturbing yet oddly charming?')  Every one lays a white card, upside down on the pile.  Read the white cards out loud ('Tasteful sideboob.  Assless chaps.  Bio-engineered turtles with acid breath')  Pick the funniest.  Those are examples I can give without being seriously edited or feeling embarrassed for writing while at work.That being said, I'm probably going to be spending the afterlife in a very hot climate.  I don't know who created these cards, or who is paying them to write this terrible nonsense, but I imagine I'll meet them in Hades one day.  Do not play this game with innocent, happy people.

You gain a clear understanding of the subtle differences between your companions' senses of humor.

I guess if you were going to be really fussy about them, you could get card protectors, but I say just give the CAH people another $25 if you are getting that much use out of the game.  It's true the 3rd expansion cards are of a slightly different make, but the quality is comparable and once you mix them in, you forget all about it.  The boxes are really HQ, so it's too bad you have to transfer the cards into a different box if you want to keep all the expansions together.  But, the BCW 660 Count- Corrugated Cardboard Storage Box is the perfect size for 3 expansions, and it fits compactly in a small backpack or satchel, which is handy.  As far as the different expansions go, I think the debates over which ones are good and which ones are 'trying too hard' or 'too gross' are pretty stupid.  Everyone is going to find different things more or less funny, so just buy them all and if you must, throw out the individual cards you hate.  There is no difference between the original cards and the expansions, IMO.  The rules have a variant where you can trade in a card for a new one, if you don't know what it means, (you just have to read it aloud to the group and admit your ignorance).  This is a GREAT rule, that everyone loves.  If you're worried about someone being uncomfortable with some of the cards, just let them trade them in (or wear them on their forehead, whatevs), and play on.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFIL47LSIYM2R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"November 18, 2013","Gruntled","-","-","Possibly the Wrongest Game Ever...!","The box says it's 'A party game for horrible people.'  It's not wrong.I played this for 'just a few minutes' at a gaming convention, where my friend Chris told me some people were playing it in one of the open gaming rooms.  He'd played it at another convention, and described it for me, whereupon I asked him to please grab me if another game started.If you've played 'Apples to Apples', you have a good grasp of the game mechanics.  If you haven't, here's a brief summary.  All the players have a hand made up of white cards.  As play passes around the table, one player lays his or her hand down, and takes one of the black cards, reading it aloud, and letting the others play one or more white cards to complete the sentence.  The player reading the black card then has to determine, without knowing who played each card, which one is the funniest.One card reads: 'I don't know what weapons World War Three will be fought with, but World War Four will be fought with (blank).'  The winning response was too appalling to list here...as is usually the case.  Expansions come out fairly regularly; expect to see 'Miley Cyrus' and 'twerking' in a future set.  If you can't wait that long, the expansions all have blank cards so you can write your own questions and answers.The game is *so* not for children.  In fact, anyone even slightly offended by real life should consider themselves warned to walk the other way when this game is out.  For everyone else, you'll be entertained, and more ashamed of yourself than you ever thought possible.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33IJXHLJU8632/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"July 10, 2014","tabitha","-","-","Very fun game! It's just like Apples to Apples but ...","Very fun game! It's just like Apples to Apples but adult themed.  4+ players, with the more the better.  It is a great activity for friends or couples, something to do at parties or just when you have over a few humorous friends.  This is a card game, with each player having a number of cards in their hand with words or phrases on them , (such as 'genital piercings' or 'lactation' ).  The players take turns being the 'picker' when they flip over a descriptive card such as 'what you think about during sex' and then the other players put in one of their word or phrased cards they think best matches the description card.  The player whose turn it is to pick the winning card chooses which one out of the bunch submitted they think best fits or is the funniest.  The winning card gets the point for that round.  Its amusing because the game changes as each player gets the chance to be the card picker.  So you really have to know your audience.  I am a very literal person when I play the cards whereas my husband chooses purely off which ever card makes him laugh most.  So each time you play it is a different scenario.  Not all the cards are risky. If you have a good sense of humor and like adult themed jokes (slightly 'naughty') then this is a good game for you.  If you are easily offended by sex jokes and are strictly religious then try playing something else (Old Maid or Bingo perhaps?)","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HOVAYS81Z91P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

I simply love this game and could not wait to play it after playing it a few months ago with some friends.  BUYYYYYYYYYYY this game if you are looking for something new to play and something to keep you entertained.  Some of the white cards suck and are more so for someone who is conservative but the majority of the cards will have u realizing just how messed up, you and your friends are. I thought playing ring of fire was bad but this game takes the cake for being that game to know about how perverted or messed up you truly are. LOL.  Wouldn't recommend for anyone that is faint of heart or who can't take a joke. Def. not a game for anyone who is super religious because you will be asking for your money back. Other than that if you don't mind a twisted game that will you have your side hurting throughout then this is the game for you especially when you have friends over for a few drinks.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V87U3C0KXJIJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

If you are one of those people that like puns, dirty jokes, or who has a slightly odd or off kilter sense of humor this is the game for you. The game offers a series of black and white cards. The black cards are similar to the old 'Mad Libs' games that everyone played as a kid where you have your friends choose words to fill in the blanks and the paragraphs often end up hilariously funny. Except in this case your friends or fellow players are given 2-3 white cards with phrases or words on them to fill the blanks on the black cards in with. Depending on the word combinations this can end up hilarious or absolutely horrible.People should be warned now. If you are seriously into political correctness, if you are sensitive and your feelings are easily hurt, or if you are in a professional setting than this is not the game for your. Cards are often about as politically incorrect as you can get, and sometimes they are downright mean.Otherwise have fun and enjoy because you will be rolling around on the floor laughing during the game session.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AZTE8RVLQ8M7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Or maybe it was due to a teenage embarrassment issue.  Anyway, some of their friends came over, and about seven of us played, including my daughter. It was awful, sort of, (Lol), but we had a lot of laughs and much fun.

Some of the cards are useless- hard to use so you end up with a handful of 'non-funny' cards so we play where we often do an 'exchange' of cards- but the game is great to play with new people! I've already ordered 4 expansion packs b/c you can only play the game about an hour or so before you run out of white cards or black cards and then it's not as funny anymore when you start playing down the same cards from before- SO, we are planning on playing again with about 6 friends this coming weekend, once my expansion packs come in the mail. I'm also going to take out the DOUBLE BLANK black cards as those are hard to play when you have a big group of friends playing. The best cards are the questions (EX: 'WHAT'S THAT SMELL?') or the single FILL-IN-THE-BLANK cards (example: '_______: Kid Tested-Mother Approved' ) with answer cards like 'Grandma' or 'Semen' or 'anal beads' LMAO  This game is definitely better played with about 5-10 people! It can be played with up to 20 but I wouldn't recommend less than 5 people and definitely no children as some of the white cards are hilariuosly VULGAR :) All-in-all, I LOVE this game- all my friends at the party were ranting and raving how they have 'GOT TO BUY THIS GAME'... They all can't wait for my new cards to come in the mail since we went through the entire box of cards in one night! I've heard the expansion packs are even better than the ones in the original box/game. So I'm excited... DO buy this game if you're into Adult Game Nights, drinking makes it funner but not necessary- Once I buy all the CAH expansions, I'll buy the Crabs Adjust Humidity card expansions too- HAVE FUN!!!","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33OUFLTH3QLDF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"November 16, 2013","Johnny O","-","yes","Who Pooped Last?","Who Pooped Last? That's how this hilarious game starts out.  You have to start each game with a discussion about the last time everyone took a dump, and the one who pooped most recently goes first.  It goes thankfully-downhill from there.  This is a rude, crude, can't believe you actually said that out loud game, which is basically an ADULT version of the much-heralded Apples to Apples game.  You have black cards and white cards. The black cards are questions, and the white cards are possible answers that you offer to match.No one likes to keep score, so here's how we play it. When someone wins a round, they get to keep the black card in front of them.  That way, every player knows their own score.  We also found that using the box cover is a great way to capture all the submitted answers each round. The reader then pulls the cards out of the cover and shuffles 'em up.  (You do have to improvise a bit when a 2- or 3-part answer is required).We've had several long rounds of laughter playing this game.  People often start laughing just to themselves after reading the latest card they drew.  You WILL hear someone say, 'I just drew a card that was perfect for that last question!'There is a small drawback, though - but there's a solution.  The drawback is that you go through a LOT of cards, and part of the fun is the novelty of the answers.  There are several expansion sets, but even better would be to have everyone create a few new cards each time you play.  The cards against humanity website offers a really L-O-N-G box ($15) to hold all the cards you can create.  You can also print out the free sets that are out there (so what if the cards aren't all the same size!).  Just mark one end of the box as DRAW HERE so you cycle through them all.Get ready to laugh, with adults, of course.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL8OMVD3FF1NA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"September 1, 2013","☮ S.Trasny","-","yes","Believe The Hype","My family's love of margaritas and juvenile humor came together as never before the night we first played Cards Against Humanity. We were all on vacation for a small family reunion. I broke out the box the second night when the folks staying at my home returned after dinner. Deceptively simple, the game quickly evoked laughter right from the first round. It's as fast or slow paced as you want and can (and did) go on for hours. Sometimes the game came to a screeching halt when a 'card czar' was laughing too hard to catch their breath or complete full sentences. A huge plus, in my opinion, is the flexibility allowing tag team play or players to simply jump in and out of the game. We started with five players. Our laughter quickly drew two more. Hosting, it was necessary to drop out occasionally to refresh snacks and drinks and it was easy to tag my adult nephew to take my place. Addicted to some candy themed game on his smart phone, he originally had no interest in playing with us, so he at first took my place begrudgingly. It was around the third time that I returned to tag him out that he asked to stay in. It was no problem to leave him be and be 'dealt in' in again myself. Because I jumped in and out of the game, other people that had been continuous players had more points. Scoring wasn't important to me, but there is a system to do so for that one family member that always plays to win. The game was a conversation topic the next day and the following night we had new additions at the table. Night two was sans margaritas, but the laughter was just as loud. One relation of mine that has never been known for her sense of humor or lightness of attitude was especially hilarious. We got some short breaks the times she was unable to speak as card czar. She shook in her chair, literally for minutes, snorting and gasping for breath. It was a side I'd never seen in her before, so I had my nephew sneak the box of cards into her luggage the day they departed. I may buy another box. I may not. I just know that I feel that only playing those two times was totally worth the money.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNJ4BDX9WJ1GP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

"November 5, 2013","Robin Landry","-","yes","hysterically funny, and easy to learn","This has got to be the most hysterical game ever invented.  It's hard to explain just exactly what the game is and what makes it so funny, but I'll give it a try.Everyone draws 7 cards which have saying on them like 'Michelle Obama's arms', then one person draws a question card, such as 'what really turns on President Obama'? then each player must lay down one of their cards as an answer.Maybe another player lays down a card that says 'ignoring third world countries', and you can see how inappropriate the game can become.Another question card might say ' ------ is a trap'.  And you might use lay down your answer card which says 'a zesty breakfast burrito' or 'estrogen', in the hopes that your card will be picked and when someone acquires a certain number of cards, they are declared the winner.To say this game brings out the worse in people is an understatement.  Your job is to answer the questions as the playing asking the question would answer, which is why the game becomes such a riot.  If the questioner is someone who can hit bottom, you job is to answer the question with a card that will reveal his/her inner prejudices, fears, bad behavior etc.I've played a lot of games and this is truly the most fun we've ever had.  I've just explained how to play it, and it's that easy.  The only thinking involved is in knowing the inner lives of your opponents.  This game is a study inside the dark, inner workings of your friends and family, and if you play it on Thanksgiving, it might just make it hard to sleep at night knowing who you share blood relations with . . .","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4XUOD6DEL703/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Cards Against Humanity may very well be one of the funniest and most vulgar experiences you can expose your friends and house-guests to without winding up in jail by the end of the evening. This game is played in virtually the same manner as Apples to Apples Party Box - The Game of Crazy Combinations (Family Edition) but with cards that would make your grandmother blush. The amount of thought and ingenuity that went into devising the cards is a masterpiece. 'My big black dick?' Check. 'Women's suffrage?' Check. 'Harry Potter Erotica?' You bet!The sheer number of possible combinations is staggering and several of the prompts for a round require multiple cards, allowing for interesting and unexpected depths of depravity for the human mind to descend into.

However, I can assure anybody that does happen to read this that Cards Against Humanity is a ridiculously fun game. With that said, it's really not a good one for kids to play, or be in the room while you play.I've owned this game for about 2 months and have played it for hours upon hours during that time period. I played a game with three other people and we used the entire black card deck just this past weekend (hours of playing) because it's really that much fun. I played with my family over Thanksgiving and my dad called me up after I had left to ask me what the 'name of that funny card game is.' I would definitely recommend this game if you are not easily offended. However, if you are sensitive to crude humor then you should steer clear of this game and buy apples to apples.I personally have enjoyed this game despite the limited number of cards (I'm now considering purchasing all of the expansions). Even if you get the same black card that you have seen a dozen times it will still have hilarious outcomes due to the white cards being different.

"February 1, 2015","JayBayinME","-","-","not for the faint-at-heart","Only the people who know you best know your true sense of humor.  With those chosen few you are at ease to say every nasty, filthy, sick, snide and snarky comment you can think of - knowing they understand you don't really mean it and will laugh right alongside you and not hold it against you. If you don't participate in foul, politically incorrect humor, then keep on shopping!  Be advised, with this game, you are exposed to the most awful and utterly disgusting ideas.  How could one even attempt to joke about such things as The Holocaust, suffering children, cancer, and testicles?  I am known for my blunt sense of humor and my caustic wit, but even I was unable to actually speak many of the phrases I concocted to win certain rounds.  As I placed down the cards, I simply hung my head in shame knowing I had bested others this round, while those around me mightily guffawed.  If you don't laugh at Howard Stern, are shocked by Daniel Tosh, and/or hate South Park, you will be horribly offended by this game. This is the most horrible, irreverent game you will ever love.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CV8BZ9C1WSRU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"January 2, 2014","Phil Clapham","-","-","Deliciously sick","I won't go into detail since 6,500 people have already done that... but will add my voice to the chorus.  If you and your friends have a sick sense of humor, this is the game for you.  It's simple and hilarious.  We were introduced to it by friends who are gay, and I have to say that playing this game with half a dozen gay men just adds to the amusement.  Each person takes it in turn to read from a black card which has a missing word or phrase, and you have to suggest the fill-in-the-blank from the white cards in your hand.  The reader then gets to decide which entry is best and the winner keeps the black card... the winner is the first to accumulate X black cards (where X is a number you select).A few winning entries will suffice to give you a flavor:The Smithsonian Institution Museum of Natural History* - [where, btw, I worked for several years] -  has a new interactive exhibit on -----Winner: 'Children on leashes'What's that smell?Winner: 'Gandhi'When I was tripping on acid, ----- turned into ----- [This is one of several two-phrase cards]Winner: White privilege, the homosexual agendaYou get the idea.  Btw, DON'T pay the absurd amount of money some sellers on Amazon are asking (currently $169!) when this is sold out... just wait till Amazon restocks and get it for the regular 25 bucks.Enjoy... just don't try playing this game with fundamentalist Christians, your grandparents or people with no imagination.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9HPSVHL9V9VO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

If you start getting the same cards, you can buy expansion packs from the manufacturer, and can purchase other third party expansion packs  such as 'crabs against humidity' . We have several sets of each.The game is a bit like Apples to Apples, but more entertaining for teens and adults. I don't suggest kids play this due to some of the content.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38NMDBG5BZQWN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

I first only purchased the original set but after playing it once I realized that  I definitely wanted to get the expansion packs and I ended up ordering all 5. If you play with a large group of people then you will go to the cards a lot faster and so the expansion packs make it to where you aren't reading the same cards over and over. ** this game isn't for just anyone and you probably wouldn't want to play it with your parents and make sure the kids aren't around.  They don't say it's a game for horrible people for nothing. I do advise ladies who play this to make sure you wear waterproof mascara because you will laugh so hard at some points in the game that you will cry. If you are wanting to spice up your game nights then this is definitely the game you want to get.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27VL6NSKDIJA1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Dry humor is a plus in this game, but anyone can play. (Well, not the kids, but I assume you know it's is adult orientated by now!) For that matter, I consider this a “drinking game” but it has nothing to do with the gameplay so much as the atmosphere that results from a group of folks who are willing to push boundaries when loosened up. If played long enough, you’ll start to see patterns and find out what makes your friends tick. Humor finds its way into categories - dark, cute, clever, political, sex, etc.  Sex almost always wins in my house. Haha.A note on the expansion packs - I've purchased all the expansion packs and the 'bigger blacker box' to hold them all. It's a wonderful investment if you like the game but not necessary at all. It gives you more cards to work with but you can always make your own cards and grow the set for free. This is a very openly customized game.PRO TIP: PRINT AT HOME FOR FREE!  The awesome creators of CAH will let anyone download the entire game as PDF from their website. Honestly. All you need is a printer and some scissors. [...] If nothing else, you can see the cards and decide if you are into this sort of thing before buying the box set.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTHUWF039VWJD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

I thought Apples to Apples was the best game when I first played that - and it still is, if you want to play with children or your mom - but if you're playing with the sort of grown ups who would make a Freudian joke *about* your mom, this game plays has the same basic mechanics, but much funnier (and more offensive) cards. This game is also all my friends' top choice for what to do at a convention when you're all wide awake but the events are over for the night. I decided that before the next con, I wanted my own set, and ordered this and as many expansions as the gift card I had handy would cover. Next time I take change to the machine in the grocery store and turn it into an Amazon gift card, I'm buying the rest!","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2K2RSLQQB4V8K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"January 7, 2015","MortensOrchid","-","-","Good time game!","Every decade we come across a board game that takes the world on fire, which is a difficult thing to do in this world full of video games and instant gratification.  This decade's board game is Cards Against Humanity, an adult version of Apples to Apples.  While the kid's version can be just as entertaining, CAH is a clearly more adult version with references to sex, drug use and bathroom humor.  This game is A LOT OF FUN with an ADULT crowd with a sense of humor.  But as we live in a world of uptightness and hearing the wrong things, PLEASE exercise caution when playing this game or even referencing this game in conversation to others.  Quite honestly, my sense of humor is not always geared towards sex, drugs and bathroom humor, because I think it's a sign of intelligence to show you do not always need to reference those things in conversation.  But I do enjoy a good sex, drugs and bathroom humor joke like the rest of them.  Have fun.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R238TYASXI5ZWT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Fun Party Game - For Horrible People Only","Warning!If you are religious, innocent, sheltered from the secular world, easily offended, or a goody-good, this game may not be for you.Are you already a horrible person?  If not, then be careful, you might have become one, after playing this game.End of Disclaimer.Cards Against Humanity Review:As it says on the box, this is 'a party game for horrible people.'  If you are already horrible, then go ahead and play. Have fun!  If you do not feel like a horrible person while you are playing, then you are probably not playing it right.- This game is basically Apples to Apples, but with horribly funny things on the cards.  This is my favorite party game.- It is so easy to play that you don't have to explain any complicated rules.  People at a party will watch one round and then want to join in.- Anyone can leave or join the game at any time without disrupting the flow. So if people arrive to the party late or leave early it is no problem.- If someone gets up to go to the bathroom or to make a drink, then the game can go on without them for a few minutes.  (I guess if you are good people, then you would wait for the person to come back so that they don't miss a round, but if you were good people you would not be playing this game.)- Again, the game does not have to stop for the remaining players as some players come and go.So if you are looking for an awesomely fun, hilariously offensive party game for you and your horrible friends, this is it.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JJUECE9PNNWY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Do you mind reading strange and offensive things that would never be allowed in a 'proper' conversation?  This is the game for you!  Consider it Apples to Apples for adults.  Granted somewhat immature adults but adults none-the-less.  You have Black cards and you have White cards.  The Black cards have a few words, sentience with blanks, or instructions that then must be filled in by the White cards.  And using the White cards to fill in the gaps in the Black cards will likely get a few reactions, for example:  'We are awful human beings.'  'We are all going straight to hell for this.'  'OMG!'  etc, etc.  Point is: your not going to be sure if it's appropriate to laugh, but your will be laughing just to break up the awkwardness.  Fun game, highly recommend it, but again only for terrible, horrible people.  Like me.

"December 15, 2012","Amazon Customer","-","yes","This game is exactly what it says it is.","We played this game for the first time the other night with four people.  Although there was drinking involved, I think we enjoyed the game so much that we were distracted from our drinking and actually remained sober the whole time we played.  We also had so much fun that we pretty rapidly forgot we were even keeping score.  I absolutely cannot wait until we play with more people because there will be more answers to decide between and choosing a winner each round will be that much harder.  As everyone else says, it is apples to apples, but x-rated.  It is absolutely hilarious, but even playing with one of the most liberal group of people I know, each of us was offended, or at least shocked, at least once.  However, we love the shock value, so that just made it more fun for us.  It would be very easy to decide to remove one or two cards because they toed the line just a little too much, but if you are going to do that, you really have no business owning this game.  If you, or someone you plan to play this with regularly are even slightly sensitive, easily offended (or able to be offended at all), or even just a really nice person with good morals, skip this game, it is pretty intense in it's vulgarity, and nothing is off limits.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RF0AV7HBGM3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

But as has become our tradition to take a shot of Fire Ball Whiskey before we play the game. You know you've ventured into some things you have been thinking and some that you haven't ever thought of before! A great tension buster, a bonding game to say the least. We were introduced to this game during a family wedding weekend and although my 17 year old told me about the game a few days prior it's not a game you expect. Everyone asks 'have you played Apples to Apples before', (for me NO), it's off the chart hysterical, vulgar and creative. Think MadLibs times infinity and so politically incorrect!! We opted for the first two expansions because we played the 3rd expansion at the family get together. I thought just the original game itself was hysterically funny. We've made some of our own rules up....having 7 cards instead of 10 is easier to manage, and our next game will somehow encompass being able to play the re-up card beings that card always seems to be the perfect card for the question card that was just presented. I am not a crude person nor am I a prude this card game is a 'let your hair down and get comfy kinda game' Make sure you don't pee your pants.*****DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ALL AUDIENCES******","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZJPFLJ1FRZM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

Many of these have been card games with friends, around a table. Sometimes with an 'adult beverage', other times not. From a 'just going to have some fun with my friends' level, this game is tough to beat.I was exposed to Cards Against Humanity at a regional Sci-Fi / Fantasy convention during a birthday party for one of our guests. A nice young lady was sitting at a table with the game, another young lady noticed it and started talking about how fun it was,  and next thing you know it, our Guest was at the table and we were laughing our butts off.  We were laughing hard enough that there were tears. This is a good sign you have a good game. I will say this - the group playing was all very creative, intelligent, and shall we say... twisted. It was a 4 day gathering of Geeks after all.  I enjoyed the game so much, I pulled out my 'droid and ordered the game and the expansion, on the spot!This game is not for everyone (especially kids). If you get offended, ever, at anything - do not buy it. It has language, ideas, concepts, phrases, and so on that will make you cringe. If you have a group of friends that watch NASCAR, WWE, NFL, etc as 'entertainment' all the time ... this game isn't for you. If you have open minded friends, who like to have fun, laugh, and let offensive things roll off your back - then by all means get this game. If you laugh at things that are WRONG - then get this game.It's been called Apples to Apples for 'grown ups', and that is fairly accurate. Game play is similar, with a few twists. Rather than a word, person, or place - you work with a concept and try to match what you think the 'Card Czar' will choose. It is NOT Apples to Apples - it's more.  Just buy the dang thing.Fun level: Yes, 5 stars. But not for everyone. Seriously. This game is not fun for everyone.Educational value: Yes, 5 stars. You learn A LOT about your friends playing this game.. hehe.Durability: Yes, 5 Stars. It's a card game, on pretty heavy cards.  Should last you a good long while.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14YM2NQV4ZMNB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

But as my 15 friends and I started playing, the fun couldn't be contained. We played, played, played, and played, revealing how creative and how screwed up all our minds are. Even my friends who I thought were innocent, nice, sweet, and bubbly, won the game with their most twisted card choices. I will never look at them the same way again.Hours went by as the laughter ensued.We all had fun.The thing is, unless you buy the expansion packs or play only on special party occasions, this game could get old.In addition, I was lucky that my friends don't get seriously offended because, trust me, some combinations can be.So, don't play it too much with the same people and don't play it with the prudish and the easily offended.Please, if you doubt this game, don't.

Our family laughs so hard we beg to stop so our jaws can rest from all of the chuckles, chortles, guffaws, howls and belly laughs. We gasp for breath, and wipe tears from laughing so hard. We gasp in shock as a 'sweet' person plays an unexpected and not politically-correct card. Not for the delicate or easily offended, this game will have you learn all sorts of things about friends or family members. We will pull some of the racier cards when in more genteel company, but nothing beats a rip-roaring game with the family. With all of the distractions and busy lives our family leads, nothing other than calling my kids for dinner gets them to come running faster than, 'Anybody want to play Cards Against Humanity?' Family game night is back in the house!

I'm in dental school where sometimes you get a little downtime between patients or rotations. This game is how we pass the time, and it's been a very inclusive game because you can play it with just a few people or a huge crowd.Like others, I'd probably describe it as a dirty version of Apples-to-Apples. Honestly, it's like Apples-to-Apples had a baby with Urban Dictionary and this was the result. Heck, I've even played it with my parents and family before and even that is a hilarious experience despite it's moments of awkward pauses. But then again, my family consists of three brothers (all in their twenties), my parents (in their early fifties), and myself, so that might explain how we can play a ridiculous game like this with no shame. But as you can see, it's great for adults of all ages who have a sense of humor (this game WILL be crude, guaranteed) and even  parties. I plan on breaking it out on Thanksgiving and Christmas this year since there's no person under the age of 19 anymore in my extended family.If you want a preview of the types of topics / cards in the game, go to the manufacturer's website. There's a PDF you can download and determine for yourself if this is a game that's kosher or worth investing in (and it is).","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7B78B30KF8HU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

It is not for people who are easily offended, have a problem with racist, religious, political, or pretty much any other hot button issue being made fun of. We bought some expansions and are going to play again soon. This is definitely great for an adult game night. I would suggest 4-6 players with this deck. 6+ you will probably need to add some expansions to make the game last longer.

Funglish.This is my new favorite game. Like Apples to Apples, but a million times funnier, if you are a horrible, horrible person like me.One person (the judge) draws a black card and reads it aloud:'TSA Guidelines now prohibit _______ on airplanes.'Everyone else surveys the seven white cards in their hand, and submits one to be judged:'necromancy''italians''harry potter erotica''morgan freeman's voice''hot pockets'The judge picks their favorite response (I'm going with hot pockets. Those things are dangerous!) and the person who submitted the card wins the round and is awarded the black card. The judge position moves to the next player in the circle...Play continues until... Something. You either get bored (never!), run out of cards (we play really long games) or someone is the clear winner (my husband usually ends up with 3x the cards as anyone else). Alternatively, you play to a certain number of wins.I love this game so much. Just buy it from the company...They release more almost every month.

We began the game with a couple of friends and my in-laws. The sickening twists to this game has brought us all closer believe it or not. At first it's scary to place the cards that you've chosen on the table. But when everyone is gasping and falling on the floor laughing, you tend to gain a little more self confidence. But don't let this game fool you. This game will also help you define your circle of friends. When playing with friends and one person keeps placing lame cards that you have to force a laugh (ha ha haha) you will reevaluate your friendship with that individual. Sad as it may be, you will become a new person playing this game. Your confidence will rise as well as you will unlock a part of your mentality that you never knew existed! I am now ordering the add-on packs so that we can continue to enjoy our time with friends, while getting the sick, twisted attributes we hinder so well out.

"September 24, 2015","Darby Shaw","-","yes","This game is entertaining for people who like to laugh at themselves","Sometimes a rating of 5/5 stars isn’t enough.  This game is entertaining for people who like to laugh at themselves, and are not sensitive to distasteful humor.  How distasteful?  Well, once while playing, the black card everyone had to answer to read “I got 99 problems but a ____________ ain’t one.”  The winning card read “Opera crying into a Lean Cuisine.”  While these particular cards are tame for this game, keep in mind that there are much more graphic cards.  If you are unsure if this game is for you, read the instructions for the game prior to purchase; it can be found online.  If the instruction manual seems too crass, you may be more satisfied with a rousing game of Apples To Apples.Aside from what type of person would enjoy this game, it should also be noted that these cards are on very heavy card stock.  They are nearly liquid-proof, perhaps better described as liquid-tolerant.  This game is usually enjoyed with adults beverages, and it seems that the manufacturers have taken this into consideration.  The box in which these cards come in is also very compact, sturdy and durable, a perfect camping and travel companion!  It is also a terribly entertaining game for what the manufacturers describe as “a party game for horrible people.”This game can be credited with showing who share a similar sense of humor in a friend group (or family).  People who have a very particular sense of humor will continue to choose winning cards that are most similar to what they would say.  If you already know their favorite type of humor, you can use this information advantageously and play cards that they may find hilarious, even if you only find it marginally funny.  If you know you and your friends are terrible people, you all would enjoy a roaring game of Cards Against Humanity.  Want to know if your family members are not as innocent as they seem?  Get them Cards Against Humanity for the Holidays; maybe it will become a tradition to play it around the dinner table.  If sarcasm is one of your most valued character traits I’m confident you will enjoy this product.  With Cards Against Humanity, being a terrible person was never funnier, or more acceptable.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6OO7ZXQJVPYX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"February 27, 2014","Jake","-","-","Great to play with friends","What a great way to break up a night or even schedule a night to play Cards Against Humanity with a bunch of friends.  It is guranteed that at some point while playing Cards you will laugh so hard you will cry and sometimes it's not just from Cards, but from your friends reaction to why their cards weren't chosen followed by their attempt to persuade you why you should have chose their cards.  Cards is not politically correct, which is awesome, Cards is vulgar, and Cards is inappropriate.  This does not imply that you will be shouting slurs or nasty names at your friends and it is not to deter potential customers from purchasing or playing this game simply because some of the funniest players of cards are mothers, grandmothers, or stuck-up uncles.  We haven't had a single person dislike Cards after introducing them to cards, rather, they ask where they can purchase cards.In addition to the original pack we have also purchased two expansion packs.  This is not because the original was not sufficient or overplayed, rather, expansion packs make it better when you have large groups playing off of the original pack.  Buy-it, play it and have fun.  You won't regret it.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B84P9FVVULKX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"

While the price for this game is a bit high, it is a highly unique game that is well throughout and well made and I believe it is worth the price.

It's inappropriate and you actually won't even understand what some of the questions mean or what the answers are...but it doesn't matter!DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN $25 ON THIS GAME!  It's just that popular that when it goes out of stock people will sell it for upwards of $85.  Just wait for it to get back in stock.  Can't wait? (and seriously, you shouldn't wait) You can actually download your own cards from the website and make your own game.Everyone I've played this with has went out and gotten their own set.  I just gave a set to my brother and sister-in-law for Christmas (although we could not play after dinner because my mom never laughs at fart jokes and once slapped me for saying 'freaking').  Yes, it's Inappropriate Apples to Inappropriate Apples...but it's ridiculously fun, give it a try.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR1L8F86HBEHM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"July 25, 2015","Aur","-","-","Glad I finally bought this!","I've been trying to get a hold of this game in local shops for ages before finally caving and ordering it online. I'm glad I did, because playing it was a blast. The hundreds of other reviews sum up its awful humour so I'll just get to a brief product review.This set comes in a surprisingly small, neat box with a basic rule sheet. There are no blank white or black cards, so you'll need to get an expansion or make/order your own if you were expecting any. The cards that come with only just fit into the box, so if you are planning on getting expansions later on you'll either have to keep them in a separate box or perhaps order the 'expansion box' to store them. I plan to get one of the expansions ASAP since after one game of about an hour and a half, the four of us went through all the black cards. That being said, this game thrives on the variety of combinations so don't fret if you go through all the black cards in one go like we did. Just mix them up and keep going.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFZHH2LACOO5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"January 2, 2013","Tek","-","-","YOU MUST PLAY THIS GAME","This is NOT a game for your parents!!!!!!  But with the right group of people, it is a RIOT to play!  Games can go on endlessly for hours and there is never a dull moment.We're writing our own cards for all kinds of politically incorrect content.Keep an eye out on Amazon.  DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $25 FOR THIS GAME!!!  There are several marketplace sellers who gouge $80 - $100 for the game, but if you just keep an eye out for the actual OEM-supplied, fulfilled by amazon, $25 set, you will find it eventually.  Expansion sets are $10.  You can usually find the base set plus 2 expansions for $45.  Just be patient and you'll see it.In the spirit of the open license of the game, here's an alternate set of rules that I am developing to keep the endless play down to a shorter period of time and for bragging rights:Use standard poker chips, or other playing chips.  You can use all chips as 1 point each, or for parties of large number of people, use the chips in 1/5/10 denominations in order to have enough chips to go around.  All chips/points are paid to and from the bank, there is no central 'pot'.  (unless noted player-to-player payments)1.  Each player starts out with 10 points2.  Play the version of the game where the top 3 funny/best cards are chosen.  a.  The best card gets 3 points  b.  second best gets 2 points  c.  third best gets 1 point.w3.  The game ends with the first person to reach 50 points (or for smaller groups or longer games, increase the winning point requirement).4.  If a player wants to change in their entire hand for new cards, they must pay 5 chips.5.  If a player wants to swap their hand with a hand from another player, pay 5 chips to the player they swapped with.  This can be done at any time.6.  If a player writes in a custom white card and it's chosen as the winner, all players must pay 1 chip to the winning player because they were too lame to think of it themselves.  If that card is chosen as the lame card, that player must pay all other players 1 chip in shame.alt funny rules:1.  The player with the worst white card has to pay the black card reader 1 chip for the annoyance of having to read the lame white card.If we playtest any other rules that work, I'll add them in.  Good luck all!  See what you come up with!","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EJ61VQZ641QG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"November 12, 2013","Michael J. Mora","-","-","Hilarious Party Game!","If you enjoy Apples to Apples and are looking for a game that can be very risque at times you'll probably really enjoy this game!  It is very similar in play style to Apples to Apples.  One person is the judge for a round, and gets to pick which answer is the winner, just as in Apples to Apples.  However, instead of simply matching one word to another, usually there is a sentence with one missing word and each player (aside from the judge) inserts their choice into the sentence.This is a great party game if you can gather up a lot of friends who aren't easily offended.  I played this the first weekend I had the game with six other friends (which I think was a good number to play this game).  We were planning on playing other games as well that night but we ended up playing this until about 2:00 in the morning instead.  This game provided all of us with MANY laughs that night.  Ever since the first night we played this my friends' have insisted that I bring this game.The only downside to this game is that it doesn't have near as many cards as Apples to Apples does, so once you play it a few times you'll make it through all the cards.  Personally, I still think it is well worth the $25 for the amount of fun that can be had playing this game.  They also offer several expansion packs for $10 each that include more cards.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TADCLAYFDKIZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"January 2, 2018","Britt","-","yes","Belly Laughs with Mom","I broke down and purchased this for ourselves after playing it at friends parties. It is great for game nights at the house with our neighbors, or for making Christmas/Thanksgiving just a little more risque! I played this with my sister, sister in law, mom, and dad and we were all blushing at least once during the game! So much fun!","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38373OC2H6TPB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"February 21, 2018","Musicals Freak","-","-","Extremely funny game of question and answer cards.  Definitely for upper teens and older","Riotously funny card game.  The players are dealt out white cards with responses.  They then take turns reading the black cards, which have mainly one but up to three blanks on them, like the old Match Game from the seventies.  The other players offer their best response and the reader of the black question card selects the funniest.  The player giving that answer scores.  The game itself is very simple, but there are endless combinations of questions and answers, and that is where the fun is.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G2T0OQ86GK37/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"June 30, 2014","brian woolf","-","-","This game will make you a horrible person.","I picked this up since my family loves to play games like Munchkin, apples to apples, quelf, ETC.I knew what I was getting into but they were in for quite the surprise. It turns out we played through the entire deck the first time we played. it took us about three hours to complete this.The first time we played this we were sober, the second we were not.Well, you know what time it is. PROS AND CONSPros:1: Quality: The cards are of a good quality. similar to high quality playing cards.2: Quantity: there is an absurd number of cards in this game. It took five of us three hours to play through all of the cards.3: comedy. Hilarious, I won't spoil it for you guys but these cards will have you bursting out laughing the second you read them.Cons:1: they aren't water proof?Other thoughtsI really couldn't think of any cons but I didn't want to leave it empty.If you are easily offended you might not like this game. But if you have a sick sense of humor or even just a little odd you will love this.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EU772L0QXE2Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"April 21, 2015","Tommy + Mich","-","-","An Adult Game That Will Have You Rolling!","A great adult game to get to know your friends like you never thought you would! This is a refreshing change from computer or console games and is a great party game among adult friends. Some of the questions may be a bit.. um... uncomfortable to play with your parents even as an adult. It's definitely not meant for kids! No subject is off limits. If you're find with any topic, then this game will provide a ton of entertainment and laughs.There's not a lot of time consuming instruction to learn and really, no one cares who wins. It's all about the entertainment of the fill in the blank answers. You don't even have to reveal your true self since you're answering with cards based on what you think someone else will choose as their favorite answer... so anything goes!After playing a few times, you'll want to  get the extension cards since the cards tend to be very memorable! Fortunately there are many additions you can get to add to your game!","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL5LGGVCPS46V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"April 29, 2018","cvkv2","-","-","So much fun.....NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT","This game is so not politically correct that it's a breath of fresh air!!  Yes there are some pretty shocking and disgusting cards in there so please pay attention to the age requirement on this game.  Plus if there is someone that you know that gets easily offended that this game is NOT for them.  Every time I play this with my friends we laugh so hard.  It's especially funny if you are drinking alcohol (please be over 21 if drinking alcohol).","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1O8GYRPA984HT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
"August 20, 2013","JK in NC","-","-","Its like Apples to Apples, but with only hilarious cards","Price: 25 bucks for the original version. Don't pay a penny more. You can even order it direct from the manufacturer at the same price.Audience: Adults only. Don't bring this to Thanksgiving dinner or work. You cant find this at Target, because they don't want people to mistake this for a kids game. If you don't like racy humor, you probably will not want to get this, but if you do... you have struck gold!The game itself: Priceless. I had never played this before and brought it over to a good friends house. After a few beers we unsealed the game and took it for a spin. Its ridiculous in so many ways. All the cards are somewhere between hilarious, absurd, crude, sexy and 'what just happened'. The value in hearing your friends read some of the cards out loud is worth every penny. We were laughing so hard we were crying almost every round.Longevity: You're not going to play this every weekend, but if you break it out every few months: its an absolute riot. I plan to order the next expansion pack. I just wish it came with a bigger box to store all the cards together.Like I said, It plays just like Apples to Apples, but all the cards are winners. So: If you like crude jokes and you're over 18, Buy it! Just don't play it with your mom (unless your mom is more fun than you are, in which case, have at it) BUT if you don't like that kind of humor, you really should NOT get this. And don't buy this for your kids.","5","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R450LN4S5WGOB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S8F7QM","-","-"
